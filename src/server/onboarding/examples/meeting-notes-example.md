# Example: Effective Meeting Notes

This example demonstrates how to structure meeting notes for maximum value and AI assistance.

## Meeting Details

- **Meeting**: Product Planning Session Q2 2024
- **Date**: March 15, 2024
- **Attendees**: Sarah Chen (PM), Mike Rodriguez (Dev Lead), Lisa Wang (Design), Alex Thompson (Marketing)
- **Duration**: 90 minutes
- **Location**: Conference Room B / Zoom hybrid

## Context & Purpose

Quarterly planning meeting to define product roadmap for Q2 2024. This is our third quarterly planning session following the new agile framework adopted in Q1.

**Background**: Q1 showed 15% user growth but also revealed UX friction points in the onboarding flow. We need to balance new feature development with addressing technical debt.

## Key Decisions Made

### Q2 Priority: Hybrid Approach

- **Decision**: Focus on UX improvements + 2 new features
- **Rationale**: Competitive pressure requires new features, but UX issues are affecting retention
- **Timeline**: 6 sprints (12 weeks)

### Resource Allocation

- Development: 80 story points per sprint
- Design: 3 designers, 2 focused on UX overhaul
- QA: Increase testing capacity by 30%

## Action Items

| Task                       | Owner          | Due Date | Priority |
| -------------------------- | -------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Design system audit        | Lisa Wang      | March 22 | High     |

| Technical debt assessment  | Mike Rodriguez | March 25 | Medium   |
| Competitor analysis update | Alex Thompson  | April 1  | Medium   |

## Next Steps

- **Next meeting**: March 29, 2024 (Design review)
- **Follow-up needed**: Technical debt breakdown from engineering
- **Decisions pending**: Final feature prioritization after user research

## Meeting Effectiveness Notes

- **What worked well**: Clear agenda, good participation from all teams
- **What could improve**: Need better pre-meeting prep, some discussions went long
- **AI assistance opportunities**: Could help with follow-up task tracking and decision documentation
