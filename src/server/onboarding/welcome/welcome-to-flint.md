# Welcome to Flint!

## What is Flint?
Flint is a thinking system designed to extend and amplify your thinking through structured note-taking with AI assistance.

## Core Concepts

### Notes as Building Blocks
- **Plain text markdown** - your thoughts in simple, portable format
- **[[Wikilinks]]** - connect ideas with `[[note name]]` syntax
- **Note types** - different purposes (daily notes, projects, references) with tailored workflows

### The Three-Column Interface
- **Left sidebar** - your workspace with pinned and temporary notes
- **Main view** - where you write and edit your notes
- **Right sidebar** - AI chat for assistance with your notes

### AI as Thinking Partner
- AI helps with **organizing** and **connecting** your notes
- AI **assists** your thinking, never replaces it
- Ask about specific notes using `[[note name]]` in the chat

## Getting Started

### Your Daily Practice
1. **Start with daily notes** - capture thoughts, meetings, and ideas
2. **Link as you write** - use `[[]]` to connect related concepts
3. **Let structure emerge** - don't worry about perfect organization initially

### Creating Notes
- Click **"+ New Note"** in the sidebar
- Use keyboard shortcut: `Ctrl+N` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+N` (Mac)
- Create by linking: type `[[new idea]]` and click the link

### Working with Your AI Assistant
- Chat with AI in the right sidebar
- AI can search, read, and update your notes
- Reference specific notes in chat using `[[note name]]` syntax
- Ask for help organizing, finding connections, or structuring thoughts

## Your Note-Taking Philosophy
Flint believes in **frictionless capture** - get your thoughts down first, add structure later. The system grows with your thinking, helping you build connections and insights over time.
