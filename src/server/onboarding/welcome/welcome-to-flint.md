# Welcome to Flint!

Welcome to your new thinking companion. Flint isn't just another note-taking app—it's a thinking system designed to extend and amplify your natural cognitive abilities. Whether you're a researcher diving deep into complex topics, a developer organizing technical knowledge, or a creative professional connecting disparate ideas, Flint is built to help you think better.

## What Makes Flint Different

Most note-taking tools focus on storage and organization. Flint focuses on *thinking*. The difference is profound. While other tools ask you to fit your thoughts into their structures, Flint adapts to how your mind naturally works—capturing ideas quickly, making connections fluidly, and helping patterns emerge organically.

At its core, Flint operates on a simple but powerful principle: your notes should be an extension of your mind, not a filing cabinet for your thoughts. This means embracing the messiness of real thinking while providing the structure needed to build lasting knowledge.

## Understanding Notes in Flint

In Flint, everything starts with notes. But these aren't just text files—they're living building blocks of your thinking process.

**Plain Text, Powerful Connections**
Your notes are written in markdown, keeping your content simple, portable, and future-proof. No complex blocks or proprietary formats to lock you in. Just text that you can read anywhere, anytime, even decades from now.

**Wikilinks: The Magic of Connection**
The real power emerges when you start connecting ideas. Using `[[note name]]` syntax, you can link any note to any other note. Don't worry if the linked note doesn't exist yet—Flint will create it when you're ready. This frictionless linking mirrors how your brain actually works, jumping from concept to concept without bureaucratic overhead.

**Note Types: Structure When You Need It**
While Flint embraces the chaos of natural thinking, it also recognizes that different kinds of notes serve different purposes. Daily notes capture the flow of your day. Project notes develop specific initiatives. Reference notes store important information. Each type comes with tailored workflows and AI assistance, but you're never locked into rigid structures.

## Your Flint Workspace

Flint's interface reflects its philosophy of balanced structure. The three-column layout gives you everything you need without overwhelming you:

**Left Sidebar: Your Mental Workspace**
Think of the left sidebar as your desk surface. Here you'll find your pinned notes (the ones you reference constantly), temporary notes (fleeting thoughts that need capture), and system views that help you navigate your growing knowledge base. This spatial organization taps into your brain's natural ability to remember where things are located.

**Main View: Your Focused Thinking Space**
The center column is where the magic happens—where you write, edit, and develop your ideas. Clean and distraction-free, it keeps you focused on what matters: your thoughts. Whether you're drafting a daily note or developing a complex project, this space adapts to your needs.

**Right Sidebar: Your AI Thinking Partner**
Here's where Flint's AI assistant lives, ready to help when you need it. But this isn't an AI that tries to think for you—it's designed to enhance your thinking. Ask it to find connections between notes, help organize your thoughts, or surface relevant information from your knowledge base. The AI understands your notes and can reference them directly using the same `[[note name]]` syntax you use.

## The AI That Assists, Never Replaces

Flint's AI is fundamentally different from AI tools that try to generate content for you. Instead, it's designed around a core principle: you do the thinking, AI handles the tedious stuff.

**What Flint's AI Does:**
- Helps organize and structure your existing thoughts
- Discovers connections between notes you might have missed
- Manages metadata and tags automatically
- Assists with routine tasks like creating note templates
- Surfaces relevant information when you're writing

**What Flint's AI Doesn't Do:**
- Generate content to replace your thinking
- Make decisions about what you should write
- Impose external structures on your personal knowledge
- Get in the way of simply writing things down

This distinction matters because your thinking is uniquely yours. The goal isn't to outsource cognition to AI, but to amplify your natural cognitive abilities.

## Starting Your Flint Journey

**Begin with Daily Notes**
The best way to start with Flint is to begin capturing your daily experience. Create a daily note and start writing about your day—meetings, thoughts, ideas, questions. Don't worry about organization or structure; just get your thoughts out of your head and into text.

**Link as You Think**
As you write, start connecting ideas using `[[double brackets]]`. Mentioned a project? Link to `[[project name]]`. Referenced a person? Create a link to `[[person name]]`. Had an insight about a concept? Link to `[[concept name]]`. These links will become the neural pathways of your external brain.

**Let Your AI Assistant Help**
When you're ready, start experimenting with the AI assistant. Ask it to help you organize a messy note, find related notes, or identify patterns in your writing. Reference specific notes in your conversations using the `[[note name]]` syntax, and watch as the AI provides context-aware assistance.

**Create When Inspiration Strikes**
Notes in Flint can be created in multiple ways. Use the "+" button in the sidebar, hit `Ctrl+N` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+N` (Mac), or simply create a link to a note that doesn't exist yet. The method doesn't matter—what matters is capturing the idea when it strikes.

## The Philosophy Behind Flint

Flint is built on the belief that the best thinking tools get out of your way. They don't force you into rigid structures or complicated workflows. Instead, they provide just enough structure to prevent chaos while maintaining the flexibility your mind needs to make unexpected connections.

**Frictionless Capture**
The most important feature of any thinking tool is that it doesn't interfere with having thoughts. When an idea strikes, you should be able to capture it immediately without thinking about where it goes or how it fits. Organization can come later, but the idea needs to be captured now.

**Gradual Structure**
Real thinking is messy. Ideas don't emerge fully formed with perfect categorization. Flint embraces this reality by letting you start messy and add structure as patterns emerge. Your understanding of your own notes will evolve, and Flint evolves with it.

**Data Ownership**
Your thoughts belong to you, not to a tech company. Flint stores your notes as plain markdown files on your computer. You can back them up, sync them, share them, or move them to another system anytime. No vendor lock-in, no subscription hostage situation, no risk of losing years of thinking if a service shuts down.

## Your Next Steps

You're now ready to begin thinking with Flint. Start small: create a daily note and begin capturing your thoughts. Link to ideas that don't exist yet. Chat with the AI when you need help organizing or connecting ideas. Let the system grow organically as your thinking develops.

Remember, Flint is not about perfect organization or optimal productivity. It's about creating an external thinking system that genuinely enhances your ability to develop ideas, make connections, and build knowledge over time.

Your future self will thank you for starting today. Welcome to Flint—let's think together.
