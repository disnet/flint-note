# Welcome to Flint!

Welcome to Flint, a thinking system designed to extend your cognitive abilities. Whether you're researching complex topics, organizing technical knowledge, or connecting disparate ideas, Flint helps you capture thoughts quickly and build connections between them over time.

## What Makes Flint Different

Most note-taking tools focus on storage and organization. Flint focuses on thinking. Rather than forcing you to fit your thoughts into predefined structures, Flint adapts to how your mind naturally works—capturing ideas quickly, making connections between them, and letting patterns emerge organically.

Flint operates on a simple principle: your notes should be an extension of your mind, not a filing cabinet for your thoughts. This means embracing the messiness of real thinking while providing enough structure to build lasting knowledge.

## Understanding Notes in Flint

In Flint, everything starts with notes. These are the building blocks of your thinking process.

**Plain Text, Powerful Connections**
Your notes are written in markdown, keeping your content simple and portable. No complex blocks or proprietary formats—just plain text that you can read anywhere.

**Wikilinks: Connecting Ideas**
You can connect ideas using `[[note name]]` syntax to link any note to any other note. If the linked note doesn't exist yet, Flint will create it when you're ready. This frictionless linking lets you jump from concept to concept naturally.

**Note Types: Structure When You Need It**
Different kinds of notes serve different purposes. Daily notes capture the flow of your day. Project notes develop specific initiatives. Reference notes store important information. Each type comes with tailored workflows and AI assistance, but you're never locked into rigid structures.

## Your Flint Workspace

Flint uses a three-column layout designed for focus and clarity:

**Left Sidebar: Your Workspace**
The left sidebar contains your pinned notes, temporary notes, and system views for navigating your knowledge base. This spatial organization lets you remember where things are located.

**Main View: Your Writing Space**
The center column is where you write, edit, and develop your ideas. Clean and distraction-free, this space adapts to your needs whether you're drafting a daily note or developing a complex project.

**Right Sidebar: Your AI Assistant**
Flint's AI assistant is designed to enhance your thinking, not replace it. Ask it to find connections between notes, help organize your thoughts, or surface relevant information from your knowledge base. The AI understands your notes and can reference them directly using the same `[[note name]]` syntax you use.

## The AI That Assists, Never Replaces

Flint's AI is designed around a simple principle: you do the thinking, AI handles the organizational tasks.

**What Flint's AI Does:**

- Helps organize and structure your existing thoughts
- Discovers connections between notes you might have missed
- Manages metadata and tags automatically
- Assists with routine tasks like creating note templates
- Surfaces relevant information when you're writing

**What Flint's AI Doesn't Do:**

- Generate content to replace your thinking
- Make decisions about what you should write
- Impose external structures on your personal knowledge
- Get in the way of simply writing things down

Your thinking is uniquely yours. The goal is to amplify your cognitive abilities, not replace them.

## Starting Your Flint Journey

**Begin with Daily Notes**
The best way to start with Flint is to begin capturing your daily experience. Create a daily note and start writing about your day—meetings, thoughts, ideas, questions. Don't worry about organization or structure; just get your thoughts out of your head and into text.

**Link as You Think**
As you write, connect ideas using `[[double brackets]]`. Mentioned a project? Link to `[[project name]]`. Referenced a person? Create a link to `[[person name]]`. These links help you navigate between related concepts.

**Let Your AI Assistant Help**
When you're ready, start experimenting with the AI assistant. Ask it to help you organize a messy note, find related notes, or identify patterns in your writing. Reference specific notes in your conversations using the `[[note name]]` syntax for context-aware assistance.

**Create When Inspiration Strikes**
Notes can be created in multiple ways: use the "+" button in the sidebar, hit `Ctrl+N` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+N` (Mac), or create a link to a note that doesn't exist yet. What matters is capturing the idea quickly.

## The Philosophy Behind Flint

The best thinking tools get out of your way. They provide enough structure to prevent chaos while maintaining the flexibility your mind needs to make unexpected connections.

**Frictionless Capture**
A good thinking tool doesn't interfere with having thoughts. When an idea strikes, you should be able to capture it immediately without thinking about where it goes or how it fits. Organization can come later.

**Gradual Structure**
Real thinking is messy. Ideas don't emerge fully formed with perfect categorization. Flint lets you start messy and add structure as patterns emerge. Your understanding of your notes will evolve over time.

**Data Ownership**
Your thoughts belong to you. Flint stores your notes as plain markdown files on your computer. You can back them up, sync them, share them, or move them to another system anytime.

## Your Next Steps

Start small: create a daily note and begin capturing your thoughts. Link to ideas that don't exist yet. Chat with the AI when you need help organizing or connecting ideas. Let the system grow organically as your thinking develops.

Flint is about creating an external thinking system that enhances your ability to develop ideas, make connections, and build knowledge over time.
