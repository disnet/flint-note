# Tutorial 1: Your First Daily Note

Welcome to your first hands-on tutorial with Flint! In the next few minutes, you'll create your first daily note and experience how Flint captures your thoughts without getting in the way.

## What You'll Learn

- How to create a daily note
- Basic writing and editing in Flint
- Why daily notes are the perfect starting point
- How to capture thoughts naturally

## Let's Start

**Step 1: Create Your Daily Note**

Look for the **"+ New Note"** button in the left sidebar and click it. You'll see a menu—select **"Daily Note"**.

Alternatively, use the keyboard shortcut: `Ctrl+N` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+N` (Mac), then select "Daily Note" from the menu.

**Step 2: Notice What Flint Did**

Flint automatically created a note titled with today's date. You didn't have to think about naming it or where to put it—Flint handled that for you. This is "frictionless capture" in action.

**Step 3: Start Writing**

In the main editor, start writing about your day so far. Don't worry about structure or perfection. Try capturing:

- What you did this morning
- Something on your mind right now
- A meeting you had or have coming up
- Any random thoughts or ideas

Write for 2-3 minutes. This is your thinking space—use it naturally.

**Step 4: Experience the Interface**

As you write, notice:

- The clean, distraction-free editor
- How your text appears immediately with no lag
- The simplicity—just you and your thoughts
- Markdown formatting works automatically (try `**bold**` or `*italic*`)

## What You Just Experienced

You've created your first piece of external memory in Flint. This daily note is now part of your knowledge system, ready to be connected to future thoughts and ideas.

Notice what Flint didn't make you do:

- Choose a complex folder structure
- Worry about the "right" place to put it
- Fill out metadata fields
- Follow a specific template

Daily notes work because they mirror how your mind actually operates—a stream of thoughts, experiences, and ideas that naturally flow together.

## Next Steps

Keep your daily note open—you'll use it in the next tutorial where we'll learn how to connect your ideas using Flint's wikilink system.

The key insight from this tutorial: **good thinking tools get out of your way**. You just experienced what frictionless capture feels like.
