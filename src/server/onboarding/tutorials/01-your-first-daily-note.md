# Tutorial 1: Your First Daily Note

Welcome to your first hands-on tutorial with Flint! In the next few minutes, you'll create your first daily note and experience how Flint captures your thoughts without getting in the way.

## What You'll Learn

- How to access Flint's daily view
- How daily notes are created automatically as you type
- Basic writing and editing in the daily timeline
- Why the weekly view makes daily notes so powerful
- How to capture thoughts naturally across multiple days

## Let's Start

**Step 1: Open the Daily View**

Look for the **"Daily"** button in the left sidebar navigation and click it. You'll see your week timeline with individual day sections, including today highlighted with a "Today" badge.

**Step 2: Start Writing in Today's Section**

Find today's section (it will be highlighted and marked with "Today"). Click in the text area and start typing. You don't need to create anything first—just start writing.

**Step 3: Notice What Flint Did**

As soon as you started typing, Flint automatically created your daily note behind the scenes. You didn't have to think about naming it, where to put it, or any file management—Flint handled that for you. This is "frictionless capture" in action.

**Step 4: Write About Your Day**

In today's text area, start writing about your day so far. Don't worry about structure or perfection. Try capturing:

- What you did this morning
- Something on your mind right now
- A meeting you had or have coming up
- Any random thoughts or ideas

Write for 2-3 minutes. This is your thinking space—use it naturally.

**Step 5: Experience the Interface**

As you write, notice:

- The clean, distraction-free editor within the day section
- How your text appears immediately with no lag
- The weekly timeline view showing multiple days at once
- Markdown formatting works automatically (try `**bold**` or `*italic*`)
- Your content is saved automatically as you type

## What You Just Experienced

You've created your first piece of external memory in Flint. This daily note is now part of your knowledge system, ready to be connected to future thoughts and ideas.

Notice what Flint didn't make you do:

- Choose a complex folder structure
- Worry about the "right" place to put it
- Fill out metadata fields
- Follow a specific template
- Click "save"—everything is saved automatically
- Navigate away from other content—you can see the whole week at once

Daily notes work because they mirror how your mind actually operates—a stream of thoughts, experiences, and ideas that naturally flow together. The weekly timeline view lets you see patterns across days and easily add thoughts to any day.

## Next Steps

Stay in the daily view—you'll use it in the next tutorial where we'll learn how to connect your ideas using Flint's wikilink system. You can explore other days in the timeline or click on the day title to open your daily note in a focused editor.

The key insight from this tutorial: **good thinking tools get out of your way**. You just experienced what frictionless capture feels like in a timeline that lets you think across days, not just moments.
