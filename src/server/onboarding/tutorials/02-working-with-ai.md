# Tutorial 2: Working with the AI Agent

Your AI agent is more than just a writing assistant—it's a thinking partner designed to help you develop and organize your ideas. This tutorial teaches you how to work effectively together.

## Understanding Your AI Agent

Your AI agent has access to:

- **All your notes** - It can reference and connect information across your vault
- **Note structure understanding** - It knows about your note types and organization
- **Context awareness** - It remembers the conversation flow within each note
- **Task assistance** - It can help with research, writing, planning, and analysis

## Effective AI Conversations

### 1. Be Specific and Clear

**Good**: "Help me organize my research notes about renewable energy trends"
**Better**: "I have 5 research notes about solar and wind energy trends from 2020-2024. Help me create a summary that identifies the 3 most significant developments."

### 2. Provide Context

The AI works best when it understands:

- **What you're trying to accomplish**
- **What information you already have**
- **What kind of output you need**
- **Any constraints or preferences**

### 3. Ask for Specific Types of Help

Your AI agent can assist with:

- **Brainstorming**: "Help me think of topics to explore about urban planning"
- **Organization**: "How should I structure my project notes for the marketing campaign?"
- **Analysis**: "What patterns do you see in my meeting notes from this month?"
- **Writing**: "Help me write a clear summary of this research"
- **Connections**: "What other notes relate to this topic?"

## Conversation Patterns That Work

### The Iterative Approach

Start broad, then get specific:

1. "I'm working on X, what should I consider?"
2. "Of those points, help me dive deeper into Y"
3. "Now help me create an action plan for Y"

### The Building Approach

Use the AI to build up complex documents:

1. "Help me outline a report about Z"
2. "Now help me write the introduction section"
3. "Let's develop the main argument in section 2"

### The Review Approach

Use the AI to improve existing work:

1. "Review this draft and suggest improvements"
2. "What questions does this content leave unanswered?"
3. "How can I make this clearer for my audience?"

## Practice Exercise: AI-Assisted Note Creation

Let's practice by creating a note together with AI assistance:

**👉 Try this conversation with your AI agent:**

1. "I want to create a note about [choose a topic you're interested in]. Help me brainstorm what to include."

2. After the AI responds, ask: "Of those ideas, which 3 should I focus on first?"

3. Then: "Help me create an outline for a note covering those 3 areas."

4. Finally: "Now help me write the introduction section."

## Advanced AI Collaboration

### Using Notes as Context

- Reference other notes: "Based on my note about X, help me think about Y"
- Build connections: "What themes connect my notes about A, B, and C?"
- Track progress: "Looking at my project notes, what should I focus on next?"

### Task Management with AI

Your AI agent can help you:

- Break down complex projects into steps
- Identify priorities and dependencies
- Track progress and next actions
- Review and adjust plans
