## Getting Started

Flint combines traditional note-taking with AI assistance. Every note you create becomes part of a larger knowledge system that your AI agent can help you navigate and develop.

### Step 1: Understanding This Note

You're currently reading a tutorial note. Notice how it's structured with clear headings and sections. This helps both you and the AI agent understand the content.

### Step 2: Try Editing

**👉 Your first task**: Try editing this note! Add your own thoughts or questions below this line:

### Step 3: Talk to Your AI Agent

The AI agent is your thinking partner. Try asking it questions like:

- "What should I write about in my first personal note?"
- "How can I organize my thoughts effectively?"
- "What are some good note-taking practices?"

### Step 4: Create Your First Personal Note

Now that you understand the basics, create your first personal note:

1. Navigate to the main interface
2. Click "New Note" or use the keyboard shortcut
3. Choose the "note" type for general content
4. Give it a meaningful title
5. Start writing!
