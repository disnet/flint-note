# Tutorial 2: Connecting Ideas with Wikilinks

Now that you have your first daily note, let's learn how Flint helps you connect ideas together. This is where your notes start becoming a knowledge system instead of just isolated thoughts.

## What You'll Learn

- How to create wikilinks with `[[double brackets]]`
- How Flint handles links to notes that don't exist yet
- Why linking while writing is more natural than organizing later
- How connections emerge organically

## Let's Connect Your Ideas

**Step 1: Open Your Daily Note**

Go back to the daily note you created in Tutorial 1. Read through what you wrote and look for concepts that could become their own notes.

**Step 2: Identify Linkable Concepts**

As you read, look for:

- **People** you mentioned (colleagues, friends, family)
- **Projects** you're working on
- **Topics or concepts** you're thinking about
- **Places** that are relevant
- **Ideas** that could be developed further

**Step 3: Create Your First Links**

Let's say you mentioned "the quarterly review meeting" in your daily note. Here's how to link it:

1. Place your cursor at the beginning of "quarterly review meeting"
2. Type `[[` before it
3. Type `]]` after it
4. It should now look like: `[[quarterly review meeting]]`

The text will become a clickable link, even though that note doesn't exist yet.

**Step 4: Create More Links**

Go through your daily note and create 3-5 more links. Try linking:

- A person: `[[Sarah from marketing]]`
- A project: `[[website redesign project]]`
- A concept: `[[productivity workflow]]`
- An idea: `[[better meeting structure]]`

Don't worry about getting the names perfect—you can always rename notes later.

**Step 5: Experience Placeholder Notes**

Click on one of your new links. Flint will create a blank note with that name and take you to it. This is powerful—you can create notes by linking to them first, then fill them in when you're ready.

Try writing a sentence or two in this new note, then navigate back to your daily note using the left sidebar.

**Step 6: See Your Growing Network**

Notice what's happening in your left sidebar—you now have multiple notes. These links you created are building the foundation of your personal knowledge network.

## What You Just Experienced

You've discovered how Flint lets you **think in connections**. Instead of wondering "where should this go?" you simply link to concepts as they come up naturally in your writing.

Key insights from this tutorial:

- **Links come first, notes come later** - you don't need to plan your entire knowledge structure upfront
- **Context matters** - links are most meaningful when created during natural writing
- **No broken links** - Flint creates placeholder notes automatically, so you never have to worry about broken connections

## The Power of Linking While Writing

When you link concepts as you write about them, you're capturing not just the concept itself, but the relationship between ideas. Your daily note now serves as a hub connecting multiple concepts in your knowledge system.

This is how your external brain begins to mirror your internal thought processes—ideas connected to other ideas in meaningful ways.

## Next Steps

Keep writing and linking in your daily note over the next few days. Notice how easy it becomes to create connections as you write.

In the next tutorial, you'll learn how Flint's AI can help you discover connections you might have missed and assist with organizing your growing collection of notes.
