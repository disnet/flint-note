# Tutorial 2: Connecting Ideas with Wikilinks

Now that you've experienced the daily view and created some content, let's learn how Flint helps you connect ideas together. This is where your notes start becoming a knowledge system instead of just isolated thoughts.

## What You'll Learn

- How to create wikilinks with `[[double brackets]]` from the daily view
- How clicking wikilinks creates new notes and opens them in temporary tabs
- How to drag temporary tabs up to pinned tabs for your core working notes
- The philosophy of pinned vs temporary tabs for organized note-taking
- Why linking while writing is more natural than organizing later

## Let's Connect Your Ideas

**Step 1: Return to Your Daily View**

If you're not already there, click the **"Daily"** button in the left sidebar to return to your daily timeline. Look at today's entry that you wrote in Tutorial 1 and read through what you wrote, looking for concepts that could become their own notes.

**Step 2: Identify Linkable Concepts**

As you read, look for:

- **People** you mentioned (colleagues, friends, family)
- **Projects** you're working on
- **Topics or concepts** you're thinking about
- **Places** that are relevant
- **Ideas** that could be developed further

**Step 3: Create Your First Links**

Let's say you mentioned "the quarterly review meeting" in your daily note. Here's how to link it:

1. Place your cursor at the beginning of "quarterly review meeting"
2. Type `[[` before it
3. Type `]]` after it
4. It should now look like: `[[quarterly review meeting]]`

The text will become a clickable link, even though that note doesn't exist yet.

**Step 4: Create More Links**

Go through your daily note and create 3-5 more links. Try linking:

- A person: `[[Sarah from marketing]]`
- A project: `[[website redesign project]]`
- A concept: `[[productivity workflow]]`
- An idea: `[[better meeting structure]]`

Don't worry about getting the names perfect—you can always rename notes later.

**Step 5: Click Your First Link**

Click on one of your new links. Notice what happens:

1. **A new note is created automatically** with that name if it didn't exist
2. **The note opens in the main editor** for you to start writing
3. **A temporary tab appears** in the left sidebar showing this note

This is powerful—you can create notes by linking to them first, then fill them in when you're ready.

**Step 6: Explore Temporary Tabs**

Try writing a sentence or two in this new note. Now look at the left sidebar below the "Pinned" section. You'll see your new note listed as a temporary tab.

Try clicking on different wikilinks in your daily note. Each one creates a new temporary tab, letting you quickly explore different ideas without losing your place.

**Step 7: Understanding the Tab System**

Notice the two different sections in your left sidebar:

- **Pinned tabs** (at the top): Your core working notes that stay easily accessible
- **Temporary tabs** (below): Notes you're exploring or recently viewed

The temporary tabs act like browser tabs—they show your recent navigation but don't clutter your workspace permanently.

**Step 8: Try Pinning a Note**

Let's say one of the notes you created (like "website redesign project") is something you'll be working on regularly. You can promote it from a temporary tab to a pinned tab:

1. **Find the note** in your temporary tabs list
2. **Drag it up** to the "Pinned" section above
3. **Drop it there** and watch it become a pinned note

Now this note will always be easily accessible at the top of your sidebar, no matter how many other notes you explore.

## What You Just Experienced

You've discovered how Flint lets you **think in connections** while providing a flexible workspace management system. Instead of wondering "where should this go?" you simply link to concepts as they come up naturally in your writing.

Key insights from this tutorial:

- **Links come first, notes come later** - you don't need to plan your entire knowledge structure upfront
- **Context matters** - links are most meaningful when created during natural writing
- **Flexible workspace** - temporary tabs let you explore freely while pinned tabs keep your core work accessible
- **Seamless promotion** - drag and drop makes it easy to promote exploration into permanent workspace elements

## The Philosophy of Flint's Workspace

Flint's dual-tab system mirrors how your mind actually works when thinking and exploring:

**Pinned Tabs: Your Core Focus**
These are like the main projects on your desk—the 3-5 things you're actively working on. They stay put, always accessible, representing your current priorities and ongoing work.

**Temporary Tabs: Your Exploration**
These are like sticky notes and scratch paper—useful for following thoughts, exploring connections, and capturing ideas, but not meant to clutter your main workspace permanently. They naturally come and go as you think.

**The Natural Flow**
Start with temporary exploration (following wikilinks, searching), then promote the important discoveries to your pinned workspace. This lets you think freely without fear of losing focus or cluttering your core work area.

## The Power of Linking While Writing

When you link concepts as you write about them, you're capturing not just the concept itself, but the relationship between ideas. Your daily note now serves as a hub connecting multiple concepts in your knowledge system.

This is how your external brain begins to mirror your internal thought processes—ideas connected to other ideas in meaningful ways.

## Next Steps

Continue exploring the wikilink workflow:

1. **Keep writing in your daily view** - link to concepts as they come up naturally
2. **Explore temporary tabs** - click links to see how notes are created and organized automatically
3. **Experiment with pinning** - drag important notes to your pinned section to build your core workspace
4. **Notice the flow** - how temporary exploration can lead to permanent workspace additions

You now have the foundation of both knowledge connection AND workspace management. In the next tutorial, you'll learn how Flint's AI can help you discover connections you might have missed and assist with developing your ideas further.
