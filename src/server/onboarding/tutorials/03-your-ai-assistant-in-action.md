# Tutorial 3: Your AI Assistant in Action

You've created notes and linked ideas together. Now let's explore how Flint's AI can help you organize, connect, and make sense of your growing knowledge base—without doing your thinking for you.

## What You'll Learn

- How to set up your OpenRouter API key for AI access
- How to chat with Flint's AI about your notes
- How to reference specific notes in your conversations
- Practical ways AI can help organize and structure your thoughts
- The difference between AI assistance and AI replacement

## First Step: Setting Up Your AI Access

Before you can use Flint's AI assistant, you'll need to set up an OpenRouter API key. OpenRouter provides access to multiple AI models through a single API.

**Step 1: Get an OpenRouter Account**

1. Visit [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai) and create an account
2. Add some credits to your account (start small - $5-10 is plenty for initial testing)
3. **Important**: Don't enable auto-refill for your credits initially. Since this is alpha software, it's better to maintain manual control over your spending

**Step 2: Generate Your API Key**

1. In your OpenRouter dashboard, go to the API Keys section
2. Create a new API key
3. Copy the key (it starts with `sk-`)

**Step 3: Add the Key to Flint**

1. In Flint, open Settings (look for a gear icon or settings option)
2. Find the "API Keys" section
3. Paste your OpenRouter key into the "OpenRouter API Key" field
4. The key will be validated automatically (you'll see a ✓ when it's valid)
5. Your key is stored securely using your system's encrypted keychain

**Security Note**: When you save your API key, your system may prompt you to allow "Flint" access to your keychain. This is normal and secure—choose "Always Allow" to avoid repeated prompts.

## Meet Your AI Assistant

**Step 1: Open the AI Chat**

Look at the right sidebar—this is where Flint's AI assistant lives. If the sidebar isn't visible, look for a chat or AI icon to open it.

**Step 2: Reference Your Notes**

The AI can read and understand your notes. You can reference any note in your conversation using the same `[[note name]]` syntax you use for linking.

Try this: In the chat, type:

```
Can you help me organize the thoughts in [[today's date daily note]]?
```

Replace "today's date" with your actual daily note name. The AI will read your note and offer suggestions for organization.

**Step 3: Ask for Connection Discovery**

One of the AI's strengths is finding connections you might have missed. Try asking:

```
What connections do you see between my recent notes? Are there any themes or patterns emerging?
```

The AI will analyze your notes and point out relationships between ideas, recurring themes, or concepts that might benefit from being linked together.

**Step 4: Get Help with Structure**

Let's say one of your linked notes feels messy or unfocused. Try this:

```
The note [[project name]] feels scattered. Can you help me structure it better?
```

The AI will suggest ways to organize the content, create headings, or break complex ideas into clearer sections.

**Step 5: Explore Ideas Further**

You can also ask the AI to help you think through concepts. Try:

```
I'm developing ideas around [[concept name]]. What questions should I be asking myself to develop this further?
```

Notice how the AI helps you think about your ideas rather than generating ideas for you.

## Understanding AI Assistance vs. AI Replacement

**What You Just Experienced:**

- **AI reads your context** - It understands your specific notes and their relationships
- **AI suggests, you decide** - It offers organization ideas, but you choose what works
- **AI asks good questions** - It helps you think deeper about your own ideas
- **AI enhances your voice** - It helps structure your thoughts, not replace them

**What the AI Doesn't Do:**

- Generate content to fill your notes
- Make decisions about what you should think
- Impose external frameworks on your personal knowledge
- Take over your creative or analytical process

## Practical AI Collaboration Patterns

**For Daily Notes:**
"Can you help me identify the key themes from this week's daily notes?"

**For Project Notes:**
"What's missing from my thinking about [[project name]]? What questions haven't I considered?"

**For Connection Building:**
"I mentioned [[concept A]] and [[concept B]] in different notes. How might they be related?"

**for Organization:**
"This note feels chaotic. Can you suggest a structure that preserves my thoughts but makes them clearer?"

## The AI as Thinking Partner

The key insight: Flint's AI is designed to make your thinking more powerful, not to think instead of you. It's like having a research assistant who knows your notes intimately and can help you see patterns, make connections, and organize ideas.

Your thoughts, insights, and decisions remain entirely your own. The AI simply helps you process and structure them more effectively.

## Next Steps

Start incorporating the AI into your daily note-taking workflow. When you finish writing, try asking it to help you find connections or organize your thoughts.

Use it whenever you feel stuck or when a note feels messy but you're not sure how to clean it up.

In the next tutorial, we'll explore how different note types can serve different purposes in your thinking system.
