# Tutorial 4: Understanding Note Types

You've been working with daily notes, but Flint supports different note types for different kinds of thinking. Let's explore how note types can help organize your thoughts without constraining them.

## What You'll Learn

- How different note types serve different purposes
- How to create custom note types with the AI agent's help
- How the "All Notes" view gives you manual control over note types
- How note types provide structure without rigidity
- How to let your notes evolve between types naturally

## Understanding Note Types

Note types in Flint aren't rigid categories—they're more like different lenses for different kinds of thinking. Each type comes with helpful defaults and AI assistance tailored to its purpose.

**Step 1: Explore the All Notes View**

First, let's see how note types are organized. Open the sidebar and click on **"📄 Notes"** to see the All Notes view. You'll see:
- Notes grouped by type with expandable sections
- A count of notes for each type (like "daily (5)" or "project (2)")
- Action buttons next to each note type for creating notes and managing types

**Step 2: Ask the Agent to Create a Reference Note Type**

Let's create a new note type for reference notes. In the chat, ask the agent:

*"Can you help me create a new note type called 'reference' for storing information I want to keep for future reference? It should help me organize facts, concepts, and sources."*

The agent will create the note type for you and explain how it customized the AI assistance for reference notes.

**Step 3: Create a Reference Note**

Now that the agent has created the reference note type, let's use it. In the All Notes view, you'll see the new "reference" section. Click the **"+"** button next to it to create your first reference note.

Give it a name like "Machine Learning Concepts" or "Cooking Techniques" - something you'd like to remember details about.

**Step 4: Notice the AI's Specialized Help**

As you start writing in your reference note, notice how the AI assistant adapts its help:

- It asks clarifying questions to understand what you're documenting
- It suggests organizing information with clear structure
- It helps identify key facts vs. your personal commentary
- It recommends tags and connections to other notes
- It offers to help track sources and references

Try capturing:
- Key facts or information
- Your thoughts or commentary on the information
- Links to related concepts
- Sources or where you learned this

**Step 5: Explore Manual Type Control**

The All Notes view gives you full control over your note organization:

- **View Type Information**: Click the "ⓘ" button next to any note type to see its description and AI instructions
- **Create Notes**: Use the "+" button to create notes of specific types
- **Expand/Collapse**: Click the arrow next to each type name to show or hide notes
- **Change Note Types**: Select any note and edit its metadata to move it between types

**Step 6: See the Connections**

Now go back to your daily note from Tutorial 1. Can you link to your new reference note? Try adding links like:

- "Learned something interesting about [[reference topic]]"
- "Need to reference [[concept name]] for my project"

## How Note Types Work

Note types in Flint are dynamic and customizable. Each type consists of:

**Type Definition**: Stored as a folder in your workspace with an optional `_description.md` file that defines:
- The purpose of the note type
- How the AI should assist with this type
- Custom metadata fields (tags, dates, etc.)

**AI Assistance**: Each note type gets specialized help:

**Daily Notes:**
- Capture the flow of your day
- Mix of thoughts, experiences, and ideas
- Often link to other notes as topics come up
- AI helps identify themes and connections

**Reference Notes** (when created):
- Store information for future use
- More stable and factual
- AI helps organize information and suggest connections
- Serve as knowledge building blocks

**Custom Types**: You can ask the agent to create note types like:
- Meeting notes with agenda and action items
- Book notes with quotes and reflections
- Person notes with contact info and interaction history
- Project notes with goals and milestones

## The Key Insight

Note types aren't about perfect organization—they're about **appropriate assistance**. The AI's suggestions and the available tools adapt to what you're trying to accomplish.

A daily note gets help with theme identification and connection discovery. A reference note gets help with information organization and source tracking.

## Manual Control and Flexibility

The All Notes view puts you in complete control:

**Organize Visually**: See all your notes organized by type, with expandable sections showing exactly what you have.

**Change Types Easily**: Notes aren't locked into their types forever. Click on any note and edit its metadata to move it between types. The AI assistance will adapt immediately.

**Create Custom Types**: Ask the agent to create new note types whenever you need them. "Can you create a 'book notes' type?" or "I need a note type for meeting minutes."

**Manage Type Definitions**: Click the "ⓘ" button next to any note type to view or edit its description and AI instructions.

## Working Across Types

Your different note types work together seamlessly:

- Daily notes link to reference notes as topics come up
- Reference notes provide context for daily reflections
- Custom types connect to everything else through wikilinks
- The All Notes view shows these connections visually

## Next Steps

Try these activities to master note types:

1. **Ask the agent to create a custom note type** that fits your specific needs
2. **Use the All Notes view** to browse and organize your existing notes
3. **Experiment with changing note types** - select a note and move it to a different type
4. **Notice how AI assistance adapts** as you work with different note types

Don't worry about choosing the "perfect" type—start with your best guess and evolve as needed. The system is designed to adapt to how your thinking changes.
