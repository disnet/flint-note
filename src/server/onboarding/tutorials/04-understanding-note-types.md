# Tutorial 4: Understanding Note Types

You've been working with daily notes, but Flint supports different note types for different kinds of thinking. Let's explore how note types can help organize your thoughts without constraining them.

## What You'll Learn

- How different note types serve different purposes
- When to create a project note vs. a reference note vs. a daily note
- How note types provide structure without rigidity
- How to let your notes evolve between types naturally

## Understanding Note Types

Note types in Flint aren't rigid categories—they're more like different lenses for different kinds of thinking. Each type comes with helpful defaults and AI assistance tailored to its purpose.

**Step 1: Create a Project Note**

Think of something you're working on—a project at work, a personal goal, or even something like "organizing my home office." Let's create a project note for it.

Click **"+ New Note"** and select **"Project Note"**. Give it a name related to your project.

**Step 2: Notice the Difference**

Project notes often benefit from structure. Try writing:

- What you're trying to accomplish
- Current status or progress
- Next actions you need to take
- Any blockers or challenges

The AI assistant understands this is a project note and can help you think through planning, next steps, and problem-solving.

**Step 3: Create a Reference Note**

Now let's create a reference note—information you want to keep for future reference. This could be about a person, a concept, a book, or a technique.

Create a new note and select **"Reference Note"**. Name it after something you'd like to remember details about.

**Step 4: Different Thinking, Different Structure**

In your reference note, try capturing:

- Key facts or information
- Your thoughts or commentary on the information
- Links to related concepts
- Sources or where you learned this

Reference notes tend to be more stable and factual, while project notes are more dynamic and action-oriented.

**Step 5: See the Connections**

Now go back to your daily note from Tutorial 1. Can you link to either of these new notes? Try adding links like:

- "Working on [[project name]] today"
- "Learned something interesting about [[reference topic]]"

## How Note Types Work

**Daily Notes:**

- Capture the flow of your day
- Mix of thoughts, experiences, and ideas
- Often link to other notes as topics come up
- AI helps identify themes and connections

**Project Notes:**

- Focus on specific outcomes or goals
- Track progress and next actions
- AI helps with planning and problem-solving
- Can evolve as projects develop

**Reference Notes:**

- Store information for future use
- More stable and factual
- AI helps organize information and suggest connections
- Serve as knowledge building blocks

**Other Types:**
Flint may include other note types like meeting notes, book notes, or person notes—each with AI assistance tailored to that purpose.

## The Key Insight

Note types aren't about perfect organization—they're about **appropriate assistance**. The AI's suggestions and the available tools adapt to what you're trying to accomplish.

A daily note gets help with theme identification and connection discovery. A project note gets help with planning and next actions. A reference note gets help with information organization.

## Notes Can Change Types

Here's something important: notes aren't locked into their types forever. If a daily note entry about a project becomes substantial enough, you can turn it into its own project note. If a project becomes completed, you might convert it to a reference note.

The system adapts to how your thinking evolves.

## Working Across Types

Your different note types work together:

- Daily notes link to projects as you work on them
- Reference notes provide context for project decisions
- Project notes reference people and concepts
- Everything stays connected through wikilinks

## Next Steps

Experiment with different note types over the next few days. Notice how the AI's assistance changes based on the type of note you're working with.

Don't worry about choosing the "right" type—start with your best guess and let the note evolve as needed.

In our final tutorial, we'll focus on building sustainable habits for long-term knowledge building.
