# Index Note Behavior Change

This index collects notes about how people change behaviors, form habits, and why behavior change is often difficult. The central theme: behavior is shaped more by environmental context and automatic patterns than by conscious willpower.

## Core Mechanisms

These notes explain the fundamental processes underlying behavior and habit formation:

- [[permanent/permanent-note-habits-as-cue-response]] - How habits work as automatic responses to environmental cues
- [[permanent/permanent-note-context-dependent-behavior]] - Why people behave differently in different environments
- [[friction-and-behavior]] - How small obstacles shape behavior (to be created)
- [[automaticity-development]] - How behaviors become automatic through repetition (to be created)

## Effective Strategies

These notes describe approaches that work for changing behavior:

- [[permanent/permanent-note-environment-design]] - Restructuring environment to support desired behaviors
- [[habit-stacking]] - Building new habits onto existing ones (to be created)
- [[implementation-intentions]] - Using "if-then" plans to trigger behaviors (to be created)
- [[tiny-habits-method]] - Starting with behaviors so small they require no willpower (to be created)

## Why Common Approaches Fail

These notes explain limitations of traditional behavior change methods:

- [[willpower-limitations]] - Why relying on conscious effort doesn't work long-term (to be created)
- [[motivation-unreliability]] - Why motivation alone is insufficient for sustained change (to be created)
- [[complexity-as-barrier]] - How complicated behavior change plans create failure points (to be created)

## Breaking Unwanted Habits

- [[habit-breaking-strategies]] - Approaches for disrupting established patterns (to be created)
- [[cue-elimination]] - Removing triggers for unwanted behaviors (to be created)
- [[replacement-behaviors]] - Substituting new responses to existing cues (to be created)

## Related Domains

These indexes explore related topics:

- [[decision-making]] - How people make choices and why defaults matter (to be created)
- [[self-control-and-willpower]] - Understanding conscious control of behavior (to be created)
- [[learning-and-skill-acquisition]] - How practice becomes automatic (to be created)
- [[cognitive-biases]] - Mental patterns that influence behavior (to be created)

## Key Questions

- How long does it take for a behavior to become automatic?
- [[habit-formation-timeline]] (to be created)
- Can we form habits without repetition through strong emotional experiences?
- What role does identity play in sustaining behavior change?
- [[identity-based-habits]] (to be created)
- Do different types of behaviors require different change strategies?
