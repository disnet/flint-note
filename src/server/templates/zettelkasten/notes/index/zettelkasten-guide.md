# Zettelkasten Guide

Welcome to Your Zettelkasten! This vault is set up for the Zettelkasten method—a proven system for developing ideas, building knowledge, and making unexpected connections between concepts.

## What is a Zettelkasten?

The Zettelkasten (German for "slip box") is a knowledge development system created by sociologist Niklas Luhmann. Rather than organizing notes by topic in rigid hierarchies, the Zettelkasten focuses on creating atomic notes and building rich connections between them. The magic happens in the network of relationships between ideas.

## The Zettelkasten Workflow

The method uses four distinct types of notes, each serving a different purpose in your knowledge development process:

### 1. Capture with Fleeting Notes

When you encounter an interesting idea—from a conversation, while reading, or from your own thinking—capture it immediately as a **fleeting** note. These are quick, unprocessed thoughts that need further development.

**Fleeting notes are temporary.** They're meant to be processed, not accumulated.

### 2. Process Source Material with Literature Notes

When reading books, articles, or papers, create **literature** notes. These capture the key ideas from the source _in your own words_, along with your reactions and thoughts about the content.

**Literature notes connect ideas to sources.** They bridge external knowledge and your thinking.

### 3. Develop Ideas with Permanent Notes

The heart of the Zettelkasten is **permanent** notes. These are atomic notes—each containing exactly one idea, written completely in your own words, as if you're explaining it to someone else.

**Permanent notes are evergreen.** They're meant to last and compound over time.

**Key principles for permanent notes:**

- **One idea per note** - If you're writing "and" or "also," you probably need two notes
- **Complete thoughts** - Write in full sentences, not bullet points or fragments
- **Your own words** - Transform source material into your understanding
- **Context-free** - The note should make sense months or years from now
- **Densely linked** - Connect to related ideas liberally

### 4. Organize with Index Notes

**Index** notes serve as entry points into your knowledge. They organize permanent notes around themes, questions, or topics. Think of them as curated trails through your network of ideas.

**Index notes create pathways.** They help you navigate and develop larger arguments.

## Using Flint for Zettelkasten

Now that you understand the four types of notes, here's how Flint makes it easy: **fleeting**, **literature**, **permanent**, and **index** are actual note types in this vault—not just concepts or folder names!

### Creating Notes by Type

**To create a note of a specific type:**

1. Look at the "New Note" button in the left sidebar
2. Click the small arrow (▼) next to it—this opens a dropdown menu
3. Select the note type you want: **fleeting**, **literature**, **permanent**, or **index**
4. Your new note will be created with the correct type already set

### Viewing Note Types

**To see what type a note is:**

- Open any note
- Click the "Show metadata" button

**To see all your note types:**

- Click "All notes" in the left sidebar
- You'll see a list of note types with counts showing how many notes of each type you have
- This gives you a quick overview of your Zettelkasten's composition

**About changing types:**
If you need to change a note's type, open the note and click the "Show metadata" button. Then, click the "Edit" button and change the "Type" field.

## The Power of Links

In a Zettelkasten, links are where the magic happens. Every time you create a permanent note, ask yourself:

- What ideas does this connect to?
- What does this contradict or challenge?
- What does this support or extend?
- What questions does this answer?
- What new questions does this raise?

Create links using `[[note name]]` syntax. If the note doesn't exist yet, that's fine—create it when you're ready to develop that idea.

## Starting Your Zettelkasten

1. Read something interesting
2. Create a literature note about it (click the arrow next to "New Note" and select **literature**)
3. Extract one interesting idea into a permanent note (use the **permanent** note type)
4. Write that idea in your own words
5. Think about what it connects to and link to related notes using `[[note name]]` syntax
6. Repeat

Your Zettelkasten will grow organically as you develop ideas. Don't worry about perfect organization—focus on clear thinking and rich connections.

As you work, Flint will help you stay organized by showing you note type counts in the sidebar, so you can see at a glance how many fleeting notes need processing or how your permanent notes are growing.

## The Zettelkasten Philosophy

**Bottom-up, not top-down** - Don't create elaborate folder systems or category hierarchies before you have notes. Let structure emerge from the connections between ideas.

**Write for understanding** - The act of writing permanent notes in your own words forces you to truly understand ideas, not just collect them.

**Let interests guide you** - Follow what's interesting, not what you "should" study. The Zettelkasten works best when driven by genuine curiosity.

**Ideas compound** - Each new permanent note makes your Zettelkasten more valuable. Ideas build on ideas, patterns emerge, and unexpected connections appear.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**Don't collect without processing** - A pile of unprocessed fleeting notes isn't a Zettelkasten. The value comes from creating permanent notes.

**Don't copy-paste from sources** - Writing things in your own words is what creates understanding.

**Don't make notes too long** - If a note covers multiple ideas, split it. Atomic notes create more connection opportunities.

**Don't forget to link** - A permanent note without connections is orphaned. The network is the system.

## Your Next Steps

Start by reading the [[permanent/zettelkasten-workflow]] note for a detailed walkthrough of the process. Then begin with something simple:

- Find an article or book chapter that interests you
- Create a literature note about it
- Extract one idea into a permanent note
- Think about what it connects to

Your Zettelkasten journey begins with a single note.

## Example Notes

To see what different note types look like in practice, explore these examples:

- [[fleeting/fleeting-note-example]] - A quick capture of an interesting thought
- [[literature/literature-note-example]] - Notes from reading a book chapter
- [[permanent/permanent-note-context-dependent-behavior]] - A developed idea about behavior
- [[permanent/permanent-note-habits-as-cue-response]] - How habits work mechanistically
- [[permanent/permanent-note-environment-design]] - Applying ideas to behavior change
- [[index/index-note-behavior-change]] - Organizing notes around a theme

These examples show how notes progress from fleeting thoughts and reading notes into permanent, interconnected ideas.

Start exploring, and remember: the best Zettelkasten is the one you actually use.
