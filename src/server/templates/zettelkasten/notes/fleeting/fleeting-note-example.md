# fleeting: Design patterns across languages

#fleeting

Was reading some Rust code today and noticed how their trait system feels similar to TypeScript interfaces but more powerful. Makes me wonder if there's a deeper pattern about how type systems express contracts between code components.

Also - the borrow checker in Rust prevents bugs that would be runtime errors in other languages. Is there a general principle about moving error detection earlier in the development cycle?

**Process this note:**

- Look up formal comparison of type systems
- Create permanent note about "contract-based programming" if it's a real pattern
- Explore relationship between compile-time vs runtime error detection
