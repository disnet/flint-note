# Fleeting Note Example

Was reading some Rust code today and noticed how their trait system feels similar to TypeScript interfaces but more powerful. Makes me wonder if there's a deeper pattern about how type systems express contracts between code components.

Also - the borrow checker in Rust prevents bugs that would be runtime errors in other languages. Is there a general principle about moving error detection earlier in the development cycle?

**Process this note:**

- Look up formal comparison of type systems
- Create permanent note about "contract-based programming" if it's a real pattern
- Explore relationship between compile-time vs runtime error detection

**About Fleeting Notes in Flint:**

Fleeting notes are meant to be quick captures—you create them when an interesting thought occurs to you. They're **temporary** by design. Set aside time regularly (daily or weekly) to process them into permanent notes or discard them if they no longer seem valuable.
