# Zettelkasten Workflow

This note provides a detailed walkthrough of the Zettelkasten process, from capturing fleeting ideas to building a network of permanent notes.

**Using Flint:** Throughout this guide, remember that you can create notes of specific types by clicking the arrow (▼) next to the "New Note" button in the left sidebar. Select **fleeting**, **literature**, **permanent**, or **index** depending on which step you're on.

## The Complete Workflow

### Step 1: Capture Fleeting Thoughts

Create a **fleeting** note whenever you have a thought worth remembering:

- An insight during a conversation
- A question that occurred to you
- A connection between ideas
- Something that surprised or confused you

**Example fleeting note:**

```
Maybe the reason habits are hard to break is because they're
context-dependent? Noticed I automatically check phone when sitting
at desk, but not when cooking. Context triggers behavior?
```

**Important:** Set aside time regularly (daily or weekly) to process fleeting notes. They're meant to be temporary.

### Step 2: Create Literature Notes

When reading books, articles, papers, or watching videos, create **literature** notes that capture:

- The main arguments or ideas from the source
- Quotes that resonated (with page numbers)
- Your reactions, questions, and criticisms
- Connections to your existing knowledge

**Write in your own words** as much as possible. The goal is understanding, not summarizing.

**Example literature note structure:**

```
# [Author Name] - [Title]

## Main Ideas
[Key concepts in your own words]

## Notable Quotes
> "Quote text" (p. 42)

## My Thoughts
[Your reactions, questions, connections]

## Potential Permanent Notes
- [Idea that could become a permanent note]
- [Another idea worth developing]
```

### Step 3: Transform into Permanent Notes

This is where the real work happens. Review your fleeting and literature notes and ask:

**"What idea here is worth developing?"**

For each idea:

1. **Extract the atomic concept** - Isolate one clear idea
2. **Write it in your own words** - Explain it as if teaching someone
3. **Provide context** - Why is this idea interesting or important?
4. **Add connections** - Link to related permanent notes
5. **Write in complete sentences** - Future you needs to understand this

**Example permanent note:**

```
# Context-Dependent Behavior

Behaviors are often triggered by environmental context rather than
conscious decision-making. The same person might automatically reach
for their phone when sitting at their desk (familiar context) but not
when cooking (different context), even though the phone is equally
accessible in both situations.

This suggests habits are less about willpower and more about managing
environmental triggers.

### Step 4: Build Connection Networks

After creating a permanent note, don't stop there. Actively build connections:

**Link to related notes:**

- Notes that support this idea
- Notes that contradict it
- Notes that provide examples
- Notes that extend the concept

**Update existing notes:**

- Add links from older notes to this new note
- Update index notes to include this note
- Add this note to relevant note sequences

**Create new notes when needed:**

- If you reference a concept that doesn't have a note yet, create it
- If this note raises questions, create question notes

### Step 5: Use Index Notes for Navigation

Create **index** notes to organize permanent notes around themes:

**Example index note:**

```
# Behavior Change

This index collects notes about how people change behaviors and form habits.

## Core Concepts
- [[context-dependent-behavior]]
- [[habit-formation]]
- [[implementation-intentions]]

## Strategies
- [[environment-design]]
- [[habit-breaking-strategies]]
- [[identity-based-habits]]

## Related Indexes
- [[decision-making]]
- [[willpower-and-self-control]]
```

## Processing Schedule

**Daily (5-10 minutes):**

- Review today's fleeting notes
- Convert any that are ready into permanent notes
- Delete or combine fleeting notes that have been processed

**Weekly (30-60 minutes):**

- Review literature notes from the past week
- Extract permanent notes from key ideas
- Update index notes with new permanent notes
- Follow interesting connection trails

## Quality Over Quantity

**Don't rush to create permanent notes.** A good permanent note requires:

- Clear understanding of the idea
- Thoughtful connections to existing notes
- Writing in your own words

**It's better to create one excellent permanent note per week than ten mediocre ones.**

## The Compounding Effect

Your Zettelkasten becomes more valuable with each permanent note:

- More notes create more potential connections
- Patterns and themes emerge naturally
- Related ideas cluster together
- Writing becomes easier as you build on existing notes

After several months, you'll find that:

- New permanent notes connect to many existing notes
- Index notes reveal themes in your thinking
- You can trace idea development over time
- Writing longer pieces becomes assembling permanent notes

## Common Workflow Questions

**"Should I create literature notes for everything I read?"**

No. Only for materials where you want to extract ideas and develop your thinking. Not everything deserves deep processing.

**"How do I know if a fleeting note is ready to become permanent?"**

When you can explain the idea clearly in your own words and see how it connects to your existing knowledge.

**"What if I can't think of connections for a new permanent note?"**

That's a sign you might not understand the idea well enough yet. Keep it as a literature or fleeting note until connections become clear.

**"How many links should a permanent note have?"**

Quality over quantity. Even 2-3 meaningful connections are better than 20 weak ones. But if you see a genuine connection, always create the link.

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the workflow:

1. Start with your current reading or a recent fleeting thought
2. Create your first literature or fleeting note
3. Extract one idea into a permanent note
4. Think about what it connects to
5. Create those connection links

The workflow becomes natural with practice. Focus on clear thinking and meaningful connections, and your Zettelkasten will grow organically.
