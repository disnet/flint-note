# Permanent Note Context Dependent Behavior

The same person will behave differently in different environmental contexts, not because of changes in willpower or character, but because environmental context automatically triggers different behavioral patterns.

This phenomenon explains why someone might automatically check their phone when sitting at their desk but never think to do so while cooking, even though the phone is equally accessible in both situations. The desk context triggers the phone-checking behavior; the cooking context does not. The behavior is bound to the context, not to the person's general habits or intentions.

Context dependence operates below conscious awareness. You don't think "I'm at my desk, therefore I should check my phone" - the context automatically initiates the behavior without conscious deliberation. This is why changing behavior through willpower alone is difficult: you're trying to consciously override automatic, context-triggered responses.

The implication is profound: **behavior is not primarily a function of character or willpower, but of environment.** The "same person" is actually a collection of different behavioral patterns, each triggered by specific contexts.

## Why This Matters

**For self-understanding:** If you behave differently in different contexts, which one is the "real you"? Context dependence suggests this question is poorly formed - your behavior is situational, not fixed.

**For behavior change:** Trying to "be better" across all contexts is harder than changing one specific context. Instead of trying to "be more productive," redesign your work environment to trigger productive behaviors.

**For predictions:** Understanding someone's usual contexts predicts their behavior better than understanding their stated intentions or values. People are creatures of circumstance more than creatures of conscious choice.

## Examples

- A person who exercises consistently at the gym may never exercise at home, even with home equipment
- Someone productive in an office may struggle working from home in the same room they use for leisure
- A person who eats healthy at home may automatically make different choices in a restaurant setting
