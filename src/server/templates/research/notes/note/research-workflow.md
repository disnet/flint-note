# Research Workflow

This research vault is set up to help you organize academic research, literature reviews, and paper analysis.

## Note Types in This Vault

### Papers

Use the **paper** note type for research papers and academic literature. Papers support metadata like:

- Authors
- Publication year
- Venue (conference/journal)
- DOI and URLs

Example: Create a paper note for "Attention Is All You Need" and add metadata about the authors, year (2017), and venue (NeurIPS).

### Concepts

The **concept** note type is perfect for research concepts, theories, and methodologies. Use these to build your theoretical framework and connect related ideas.

Example: Create concept notes for "Transformers", "Self-Attention", "Positional Encoding"

### Daily Research Log

Your **daily** notes become a research journal where you track:

- Experiments and results
- Questions that arise during reading
- Insights and connections
- Progress on different projects

### General Notes

Use regular **notes** for everything else: meeting notes, project planning, random thoughts, and work-in-progress ideas.

## Recommended Workflow

### 1. Paper Reading

When you read a new paper:

1. Create a paper note with the title
2. Add metadata (authors, year, venue, DOI)
3. Summarize key findings and methodology
4. Link to related `[[concepts]]` and other `[[papers]]`
5. Note any questions or ideas in your daily log

### 2. Literature Review

To organize a literature review:

1. Create concept notes for main themes
2. Link papers to relevant concepts
3. Use your daily notes to synthesize across papers
4. Build a network of connections between papers and concepts

### 3. Building Understanding

As you develop expertise:

1. Regularly review and update concept notes
2. Add new connections as you discover them
3. Use the AI assistant to find related papers and concepts
4. Track emerging questions in your daily research log

## Using Wikilinks for Research

Link everything together:

- `[[Paper Title]]` - link to paper notes
- `[[Concept Name]]` - link to concept notes
- `[[Research Question]]` - create notes for research questions
- `[[Experiment 2024-01-15]]` - link to experiment notes

## AI Assistant for Research

Your AI assistant can help with:

- Finding related papers in your vault
- Identifying connections between concepts
- Suggesting papers for a literature review
- Organizing notes from a paper reading session

Try asking: "Find all papers related to [[transformer architectures]]"

## Getting Started

1. Add your first paper using the paper note type
2. Create concept notes for the main ideas
3. Link concepts together as you discover connections
4. Use daily notes to track your research progress
5. Let the knowledge graph emerge organically

Remember: The goal is to build a personal research knowledge base that grows smarter over time. Don't worry about perfect organization from the start—focus on capturing insights and making connections.
