# Getting Started

Welcome! Here are some quick tips to help you get the most out of Flint.

## Daily Notes

The easiest way to start using Flint is with daily notes. Click on **Daily** in the left sidebar to see your week at a glance. Each day has its own section where you can capture thoughts, meetings, ideas, and tasks.

Daily notes are perfect for:

- Morning planning and intention setting
- Meeting notes and outcomes
- Random thoughts and observations
- End-of-day reflections
- Quick task capture

## Creating Notes

There are several ways to create new notes:

1. **Quick Create**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+N` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+N` (Mac)
2. **Sidebar Button**: Click the "+" button in the left sidebar
3. **Wikilinks**: Type `[[New Note Name]]` anywhere, and Flint will create it when you're ready

## Connecting Ideas with Wikilinks

One of Flint's most powerful features is the ability to link notes together using wikilinks.

To create a link: `[[note name]]`

Don't worry if the note doesn't exist yet—Flint will create it when you click the link. This lets you build a network of connected thoughts organically.

## Using the AI Assistant

The AI assistant in the right sidebar is here to help you organize and connect your thoughts.

Try asking it to:

- Find related notes on a topic
- Help organize a messy note
- Identify patterns in your notes
- Suggest connections between ideas

The AI can reference your notes using the same `[[note name]]` syntax, making it context-aware.

## Organizing with Note Types

As your vault grows, you might want to create custom note types for different purposes:

- **Projects**: Track initiatives and work
- **People**: Notes about individuals you work with
- **Concepts**: Big ideas you're exploring
- **References**: Information you want to save

Create custom note types to give your notes structure and get tailored AI assistance.

## Tips for Success

**Start Messy**: Don't worry about perfect organization from day one. Capture thoughts first, organize later.

**Link Liberally**: When in doubt, create a link. Connections are what make your knowledge base valuable.

**Daily Practice**: Try to write something every day, even if it's just a few sentences. Consistency builds momentum.

**Ask the AI**: When you're stuck or need help, chat with the AI assistant. It's designed to enhance your thinking process.

## Next Steps

1. Create your first daily note
2. Write about what's on your mind
3. Link to a concept or project using `[[wikilinks]]`
4. Try asking the AI assistant a question about your notes

Remember: Flint is a tool for thinking, not a filing system. Let your thoughts flow naturally, and the structure will emerge over time.
