# Writing Habits of Famous Authors

Research into how successful writers actually work. Looking for patterns that inform my own practice.

## Daily Routines

### Word Count Targets

| Author           | Daily Target     | Notes                                                                             |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Stephen King     | 2,000 words      | "The first draft of a book—even a long one—should take no more than three months" |
| Ernest Hemingway | 500-1,000 words  | Stopped mid-sentence to make starting easier next day                             |
| Anthony Trollope | 250 words/15 min | Wrote by the clock, incredibly consistent                                         |
| Maya Angelou     | No word count    | Worked in hotel rooms, rented specifically for writing                            |

What strikes me: the consistency matters more than the quantity. See [[Flow States]] on the power of ritual.

### Time of Day

**Morning writers** (most common):

- Hemingway: First light, standing at a tall desk
- Toni Morrison: Before dawn, watching the sun rise
- Haruki Murakami: 4 AM start, writes for 5-6 hours

**Night writers** (minority):

- Franz Kafka: 10 PM to 2 AM
- Marcel Proust: Midnight to 3 AM, in a cork-lined room

The pattern: protect a consistent time block, regardless of when.

### Workspace

Maya Angelou's hotel room approach is fascinating - she'd rent a room, remove all decoration, and work there. Pure environment design.

> "I go into the room and I feel as if all my beliefs are suspended. Nothing holds me to anything."

This connects to [[The Art of Doing Science]] - Hamming's focus on removing distractions from important work.

## Starting Rituals

### Hemingway's Mid-Sentence Stop

Always stopped while knowing what came next. This made starting the next day easier - no blank page terror.

### Victor Hugo's Naked Writing

Supposedly had his valet take his clothes to prevent him from going out until he'd written.

### Don DeLillo's Reading Start

Always began by reading what he wrote the day before. Momentum building.

I'm experimenting with variants of these in [[Morning pages experiment]].

## On First Drafts

### Hemingway

> "The first draft of anything is shit."

### Anne Lamott

> "Almost all good writing begins with terrible first efforts."

### Neil Gaiman

> "For me, it's always been a process of trying to convince myself that what I wrote in the first draft isn't so bad."

The pattern: universal acceptance that first drafts are rough. Permission to be imperfect. This is the foundation of [[Bird by Bird]].

## Dealing with Blocks

### Raymond Chandler's Rule

When stuck, have someone come through the door with a gun. (Introduce new conflict.)

### John McPhee's Approach

Write "Dear Mother" at the top and explain what he's trying to say. Then delete the salutation.

### Neil Gaiman

> "If you're stuck, figure out what would happen next if it were going wrong."

## Physical Activity

Almost universally, successful writers walk:

- Dickens: 20+ miles daily
- Woolf: Walked around London
- Thoreau: 4 hours daily
- Nietzsche: "All truly great thoughts are conceived while walking"

This connects to [[The Science of Creativity]] on incubation - walking allows the unconscious to work.

## Reading Habits

Heavy readers, all of them. King's famous advice:

> "If you don't have time to read, you don't have the time (or the tools) to write."

This is the "preparation" phase of creativity - filling the well.

## What I'm Taking From This

For my own practice (see [[Book Project - Working Title]]):

1. **Consistent time** - Morning seems to work for most; trying 6-8 AM
2. **Modest daily goal** - 500 words feels sustainable
3. **Stop mid-thought** - Hemingway's trick for easier starts
4. **Daily walks** - Build incubation time into the schedule
5. **Permission for rough drafts** - The universal truth

## Tracking My Experiments

| Week         | Routine              | Result                        |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Dec 15-21    | Evening writing      | Inconsistent, tired           |
| Dec 22-28    | Morning 6-8 AM       | Better focus, harder to start |
| Dec 29-Jan 4 | Morning + walk after | Flow states more frequent     |

The morning + walk combination is working. Building this into permanent habit.
