# AI in Note-Taking Apps

Research into how AI is transforming personal knowledge management.

## Current Landscape

The integration of AI into note-taking is rapidly evolving:

1. **Summarization** - Condense long notes automatically
2. **Organization** - Smart tagging and categorization
3. **Generation** - Expand bullet points into full text
4. **Search** - Semantic search beyond keyword matching

## Key Players

| App     | AI Features             |
| ------- | ----------------------- |
| Notion  | AI writing, summaries   |
| Mem     | Memory-based search     |
| Reflect | AI chat with notes      |
| Flint   | Context-aware assistant |

## User Expectations

From user research, people want AI that:

- Respects their privacy (local processing preferred)
- Enhances without replacing their thinking
- Works seamlessly in the writing flow
- Learns from their personal style

## Technical Approaches

### On-Device Processing

- Faster response times
- Better privacy
- Limited model capabilities

### Cloud Processing

- More powerful models
- Requires internet connection
- Privacy concerns

## Our Strategy

Focus on **augmentation, not replacement**:

1. Help users organize existing notes
2. Surface relevant connections
3. Assist with writer's block
4. Never change notes without explicit action
