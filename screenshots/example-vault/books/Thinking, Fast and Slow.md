# Thinking, Fast and Slow

**Author:** Daniel Kahneman
**Status:** Finished
**Rating:** 5/5

## Overview

Kahneman's masterwork on the two systems that drive how we think. This has fundamentally changed how I understand my own creative process and decision-making.

## Key Concepts

### System 1 and System 2

- **System 1**: Fast, automatic, intuitive, emotional
- **System 2**: Slow, deliberate, logical, effortful

The interplay between these systems explains so much about [[Flow States]] and why creative work sometimes feels effortless and other times like pushing a boulder uphill.

### Cognitive Ease

When something feels easy to process, we're more likely to believe it's true and feel good about it. This has huge implications for writing:

> "A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth."

This connects to my thinking on [[The Science of Creativity]] - the best ideas often feel obvious in retrospect.

### The Planning Fallacy

We consistently underestimate how long things will take. Kahneman calls this "reference class forecasting" - we should look at how long similar projects took, not how long we _feel_ this one will take.

Applied to my [[Book Project - Working Title]]:

- Similar non-fiction books took authors 2-3 years
- I initially thought 6 months - clearly optimistic!

## Highlights and Quotes

> "Nothing in life is as important as you think it is, while you are thinking about it."

This is the focusing illusion. Relevant when stuck on a writing problem - step away, let System 1 work in the background.

> "We can be blind to the obvious, and we are also blind to our blindness."

Connects to Feynman's emphasis on intellectual honesty in [[The Art of Doing Science]].

| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Cognitive ease   | [[Flow States]]                      | Flow happens when System 1 can run freely        |
| Planning fallacy | [[Writing Habits of Famous Authors]] | Why daily word counts matter more than deadlines |
| Anchoring        | [[Questions to explore]]             | How first ideas constrain later thinking         |

## Questions This Raises

- How do I design my writing environment to promote cognitive ease?
- Can I train System 1 to be better at creative intuition?
- See [[Questions to explore]] for the running list

## Personal Takeaways

The biggest insight: creativity isn't about having better System 2 (conscious thinking). It's about training System 1 through practice, then knowing when to let it run. This validates Anne Lamott's advice in [[Bird by Bird]] about "shitty first drafts" - get System 1 output on paper, then use System 2 to edit.
