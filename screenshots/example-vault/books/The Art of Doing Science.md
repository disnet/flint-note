# The Art of Doing Science and Engineering

**Author:** Richard Hamming
**Status:** In Progress (Chapter 12)
**Rating:** 5/5

## Why This Book

Found this via a recommendation when researching creativity. Hamming was a mathematician at Bell Labs, and this book is essentially his philosophy on doing important work. It's not about science per se - it's about how to think.

## Core Philosophy

> "If you do not work on an important problem, it's unlikely you'll do important work."

This challenges me. Am I working on important problems? My [[Book Project - Working Title]] feels important to me, but is it important in Hamming's sense?

### The Courage to Ask Big Questions

Hamming describes how most people avoid the big questions because:

1. Fear of failure
2. Comfort in small, safe problems
3. Lack of tolerance for ambiguity

This resonates with [[The Science of Creativity]] - breakthrough thinking requires tolerating uncertainty longer than is comfortable.

## On Creativity and Constraints

### The Importance of Limitations

> "The great scientists, when an opportunity opens up, get after it and they pursue it. They drop all other things."

Constraints force focus. See [[Connection between constraints and creativity]] for my synthesis of this idea across multiple sources.

### Prepared Mind

> "Luck favors the prepared mind."

This connects to Kahneman's System 1 in [[Thinking, Fast and Slow]] - expertise is really about having a well-trained intuition. Years of focused work create the "prepared mind" that can recognize opportunities.

## Hamming's Questions

The famous "Hamming Questions" he'd ask colleagues at lunch:

1. What are the important problems in your field?
2. What important problems are you working on?
3. If what you're doing isn't important, why are you doing it?

These are uncomfortable questions. I need to apply them to my own work.

## Methods for Thinking

### Friday Afternoons

Hamming reserved Friday afternoons for "big picture" thinking - stepping back from daily work to ask whether he was going in the right direction.

I've started doing something similar - see [[Morning pages experiment]] for my version.

### Tolerance for Ambiguity

> "The ability to postpone commitment while keeping options open is a mark of intelligence."

This echoes Keats's "negative capability" - the ability to remain in uncertainty. Creative work requires sitting with not-knowing longer than feels comfortable.
