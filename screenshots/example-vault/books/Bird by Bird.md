# Bird by Bird

**Author:** Anne Lamott
**Status:** Finished (multiple re-reads)
**Rating:** 5/5

## Why I Keep Returning

This is my touchstone for the emotional reality of writing. While [[Thinking, Fast and Slow]] gives me the cognitive framework and [[The Art of Doing Science]] the philosophy, Lamott gives me permission to be human while doing this work.

## Core Ideas

### Shitty First Drafts

> "All good writers write them. This is how they end up with good second drafts and terrific third drafts."

The most liberating idea in the book. Perfectionism is the enemy. This connects directly to Kahneman's System 1/System 2 framework:

- First draft = let System 1 run
- Revision = engage System 2

See my attempts at implementing this in [[Chapter 1 Draft]].

### Bird by Bird

The title story: Lamott's brother had a report on birds due the next day, months of procrastination behind him, paralyzed at the kitchen table. Their father sat down and said:

> "Bird by bird, buddy. Just take it bird by bird."

This is the antidote to overwhelm. Applied to my [[Book Project - Working Title]]:

- Don't think about the whole book
- Write this paragraph
- Then the next one

### The One-Inch Picture Frame

Keep a one-inch picture frame on your desk. That's all you need to write about - a one-inch moment.

> "All I have to do is write down as much as I can see through a one-inch picture frame."

This zooming in produces vivid, specific writing. Abstract → Concrete.

## On Voice

### Radio Station KFKD

The "radio station" in your head broadcasting self-doubt on one channel and grandiosity on the other. Both are lies.

Lamott's advice: acknowledge it, then write anyway.

> "Close your eyes and get quiet for a minute, until the chatter starts up. Then isolate one of the voices and imagine the person speaking as a mouse."

## Writing Practice

### Short Assignments

Start with something small. A childhood memory. A character description. A single scene.

This aligns with the research on deliberate practice - see [[The Science of Creativity]] on how constraints improve creative output.

### Writing Groups

The value of a trusted reader. Not for validation, but for seeing blind spots.

## Quotes I Return To

> "Perfectionism is the voice of the oppressor, the enemy of the people. It will keep you cramped and insane your whole life."

> "Almost all good writing begins with terrible first efforts. You need to start somewhere."

> "Writing and reading decrease our sense of isolation. They deepen and widen and expand our sense of life."

## Applied to My Work

From [[Morning pages experiment]]:

- Morning pages are essentially "shitty first drafts" of thinking
- The practice builds tolerance for imperfection
- It's training System 1 to produce without judgment

The challenge: carrying this permission into the actual book manuscript. See [[Chapter 1 Draft]] for ongoing attempts.
