# Book Project: The Creative Mind

_Working title - will probably change_

## The Pitch

A practical exploration of how creativity actually works, bridging cognitive science and the lived experience of making things. Not another "unlock your creativity" self-help book - more of an investigation into what's really happening when we create.

## Core Argument

Creativity isn't a mystical gift. It's a learnable process that combines:

1. Deep preparation (domain knowledge, research)
2. Incubation (letting the unconscious work)
3. Disciplined practice (showing up consistently)
4. Productive constraints (limits that focus the mind)

The key insight: creativity emerges from the interplay between conscious effort and unconscious processing. We can't force it, but we can create conditions where it's more likely to appear.

## Target Reader

Writers, artists, makers who want to understand their own process better. Not beginners looking for tips - people already doing creative work who want to go deeper.

2. The Preparation Phase - Why expertise matters and how to build it

- [ ] First draft
- [ ] Revision

Chapters: 5. Constraints and Freedom - The paradox of creative limits (see [[Connection between constraints and creativity]]) 6. Finding Flow - [[Flow States]] in creative work 7.

## Current Status

**Active work**: [[Chapter 1 Draft]] - struggling with the opening. Need to find the right entry point that's personal but not self-indulgent.

**Research complete for**: Chapters 1-4 (see books and research folders)

**Research needed**:

- More on collaboration and creative communities
- Case studies for constraint chapter
- See [[Questions to explore]] for specific gaps

## Word Count Targets

| Section    | Target     | Current   | Status      |
| ---------- | ---------- | --------- | ----------- |
| Part One   | 25,000     | 3,200     | In progress |
| Part Two   | 25,000     | 0         | Not started |
| Part Three | 20,000     | 0         | Not started |
| **Total**  | **70,000** | **3,200** | **4.5%**    |

## Timeline Notes

Trying not to get too attached to specific deadlines (see [[Thinking, Fast and Slow]] on planning fallacy). Instead, focusing on:

- Daily word count: 500 words
- Weekly review: Fridays (inspired by Hamming in [[The Art of Doing Science]])

## Open Questions

- Is the three-part structure right, or should it be two?
- How personal should the narrative be?
- Should I include exercises/practices, or keep it purely exploratory?

See [[Questions to explore]] for the full list.
