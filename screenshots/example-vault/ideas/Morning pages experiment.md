# Morning Pages Experiment

_A practice I'm testing, inspired by Julia Cameron and filtered through my reading on creativity._

## The Practice

Every morning, as close to waking as possible:

- 3 pages longhand (or 30 minutes, whichever comes first)
- Stream of consciousness - no editing, no stopping
- No rereading until at least a week later

## Why This Might Work

### From [[Thinking, Fast and Slow]]

In the morning, before full alertness, System 2 is sluggish. System 1 runs more freely. This might mean:

- Less internal censorship
- More access to associative thinking
- Raw material from the unconscious

### From [[Flow States]]

The "no stopping" constraint creates a kind of forced flow. Can't evaluate, can only produce. The clear goal (fill pages) and immediate feedback (words appearing) check two of the three flow requirements.

### From [[Writing Habits of Famous Authors]]

Morning writing is nearly universal among prolific authors. Something about the liminal state between sleep and full waking.

### From [[The Science of Creativity]]

This functions as both incubation capture (thoughts that arose overnight) and preparation (warming up the creative machinery).

## What I've Noticed

### Week 1-2

Mostly complaints and to-do lists. Mind clearing out surface concerns. Boring but maybe necessary.

### Week 3-4

Occasional surprises - an idea for [[Chapter 1 Draft]] emerged mid-page. Connections between notes I hadn't consciously made.

### Week 5+

Starting to feel like a "well" I can draw from. Not every session produces something useful, but the practice feels generative in a way I can't fully explain.

## Sample Morning Page Insight

From December 29:

> "...and I keep circling back to this idea that creativity isn't about having better ideas, it's about having more ideas and being willing to throw most of them away. Which connects to Kahneman somehow - System 1 produces volume, System 2 selects. So maybe the practice is about training System 1 to produce, and building tolerance for letting System 2 discard..."

This became the seed for a section in [[Chapter 1 Draft]].

## Questions and Adjustments

**Working:**

- Morning timing (before email, before coffee)
- Longhand (slows down enough to not self-edit)
- The "no stopping" rule

**Not sure:**

- Is 3 pages enough? Too much?
- Should I review them more often?
- Would typing work for some sessions?

**Trying next:**

- Occasional prompt at the top ("What's the next question for the book?")
- One session per week dedicated to project-specific thinking

## Connection to [[Bird by Bird]]

Lamott doesn't specifically recommend morning pages, but her "shitty first drafts" philosophy is essentially the same principle applied to project work. Morning pages might be training for that tolerance.
