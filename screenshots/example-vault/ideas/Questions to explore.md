## How I Use This Note

1. Add questions as they arise during reading/writing
2. Review weekly during "Friday afternoon" reflection time (per Hamming)
3. When a question gets answered, move to "Recently Answered" with link to where
4. Let questions inform what to read next

The goal isn't to answer all of them - it's to keep inquiry alive while doing the actual work.
