# UI Improvements

Design ideas and improvements for the Flint interface.

## Editor Experience

### Typography

- Consider variable fonts for better rendering
- Increase line-height slightly for readability
- Better monospace font for code blocks

### Focus Mode

- Hide sidebar completely
- Fade out all chrome
- Typewriter scrolling option

## Sidebar Refinements

### Current Pain Points

- Getting crowded with many notes
- Hard to distinguish note types visually
- Collapse state not remembered

### Proposed Solutions

1. Add folder/section collapsing
2. Color-code note types
3. Remember expansion state per session
4. Add search filter in sidebar

## Visual Polish

### Light Mode

- Softer background (#FAFAFA instead of white)
- Subtle shadows on cards
- Better contrast for secondary text

### Dark Mode

- True black option for OLED
- Reduce blue light in evening
- Better syntax highlighting colors

## Animations

Add subtle animations for:

- Note transitions
- Sidebar expand/collapse
- Modal appearance
- Successful save indicator

## Accessibility

- [ ] Improve keyboard navigation
- [ ] Add ARIA labels
- [ ] Test with screen readers
- [ ] Ensure 4.5:1 contrast ratios

## Inspiration

Looking at:

- iA Writer (focus)
- Notion (flexibility)
- Bear (aesthetics)
- Craft (polish)
