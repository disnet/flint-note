# flint-note Design Document

## Overview

**flint-note** is an agent-first note-taking application designed to help users maintain and interact with their personal knowledge base through natural language interfaces. Unlike traditional note-taking apps that add AI features as an afterthought, flint-note is architected from the ground up to be agent-native.

## Vision

Create a note-taking system where:
- Users interact primarily through natural language with AI agents
- Notes are organized by user-defined "types" with semantic meaning
- The system understands the purpose and context of different note categories
- Data remains portable and user-owned through simple file storage
- Integration is seamless with any MCP-compatible chat client

## Core Principles

1. **Agent-First**: Design every feature with AI agent interaction as the primary interface
2. **User Ownership**: All data stored as simple files in user-controlled directories
3. **Semantic Organization**: Note types carry meaning that agents can understand and act upon
4. **Extensible**: Easy to add new note types and agent behaviors
5. **Portable**: No vendor lock-in, works with standard file systems and version control

## Multi-Vault System

flint-note supports multiple vaults, allowing you to organize different collections of notes separately. Each vault is an independent workspace with its own note types, configuration, and notes. This is perfect for separating personal notes, work projects, research topics, or any other organizational structure you prefer.

### Key Features

- **Platform-specific storage**: Configuration stored in appropriate system directories (`~/.config/flint-note` on Unix, `%APPDATA%\flint-note` on Windows)
- **Easy switching**: Switch between vaults instantly without restarting the server
- **Independent workspaces**: Each vault has its own note types and configuration
- **Legacy support**: Automatically migrates existing workspaces to the vault system

### Vault Management

You can manage vaults through both the MCP server tools and the command-line interface:

#### MCP Tools
- `list_vaults` - List all configured vaults
- `create_vault` - Create a new vault
- `switch_vault` - Switch to a different vault
- `get_current_vault` - Show current vault information
- `update_vault` - Update vault name or description
- `remove_vault` - Remove vault from registry (files preserved)

#### Command Line Interface
```bash
# List all vaults
flint-note list

# Create a new vault
flint-note create work "Work Notes" ~/work-vault

# Switch to a vault
flint-note switch work

# Initialize current directory as a vault
flint-note init --id=project --name="Project Notes"

# Show current vault
flint-note current

# Update vault information
flint-note update work --name "Work & Research"

# Remove a vault (files not deleted)
flint-note remove work
```

### System Prompts and Multi-Vault Context

When working with multi-vault systems, flint-note automatically provides context to AI agents about the current vault and its purpose. This enables intelligent, vault-aware assistance:

- **Current Vault Context**: All MCP tool responses include information about which vault is currently active
- **Vault-Specific Behavior**: Agents understand the purpose and context of each vault (work, personal, research, etc.)
- **Cross-Vault Awareness**: When switching vaults, agents maintain awareness of the transition and can help organize content appropriately
- **Contextual Suggestions**: Note creation and management suggestions are tailored to the current vault's purpose and existing content

## Agent Instructions System

The agent instructions system is a core feature that enables users to define specific behaviors and guidance for AI agents when working with different note types. This creates a personalized, context-aware experience where agents understand the purpose and conventions of each note category.

### How Agent Instructions Work

1. **Per-Note-Type Guidance**: Each note type can have its own set of agent instructions
2. **Automatic Context**: When agents work with notes, they automatically receive relevant instructions
3. **User-Customizable**: Instructions can be easily updated using natural language through the MCP interface
4. **Contextual Responses**: Note creation responses include agent instructions and helpful suggestions
5. **Vault-Aware Context**: Agent instructions automatically include current vault information and context
6. **Cross-Vault Intelligence**: When switching vaults, agents understand the transition and adapt their behavior accordingly

### Example Agent Instructions

```markdown
## Reading Notes
- Always ask about the author's background and credentials
- Extract key insights and actionable takeaways
- Ask for the user's personal rating and recommendation
- Suggest connections to previously read books

## Project Notes
- Always ask about project goals and success criteria
- Extract and track action items with owners and deadlines
- Suggest next steps and potential blockers
- Link to related project documentation

## Meeting Notes
- Extract attendees, decisions made, and action items
- Identify follow-up meetings or deadlines
- Suggest creating linked notes for action items
- Ask about meeting effectiveness and outcomes
```

## Metadata Schema System

The metadata schema system provides structured data validation and type safety for note frontmatter, enabling consistent data collection and intelligent agent interactions.

### How Metadata Schemas Work

1. **Type-Specific Schemas**: Each note type can define its own metadata schema with field definitions
2. **Automatic Validation**: Metadata is validated against the schema when creating or updating notes
3. **Rich Field Types**: Support for strings, numbers, booleans, dates, arrays, and select fields
4. **Constraint Validation**: Enforce min/max values, string patterns, and selection options
5. **Default Values**: Automatic generation of sensible defaults for required fields

### Supported Field Types

- **string**: Text fields with optional pattern validation
- **number**: Numeric fields with min/max constraints
- **boolean**: True/false fields
- **date**: ISO date strings with automatic validation
- **array**: Lists of values with optional length constraints
- **select**: Single choice from predefined options

### Schema Definition Format

Metadata schemas are defined in the note type's `_description.md` file:

```markdown
## Metadata Schema
Expected frontmatter or metadata fields for this note type:
- title: Book title (required, string)
- author: Author name (required, string)
- rating: Personal rating (required, number, min: 1, max: 5)
- genre: Book genre (optional, string)
- isbn: ISBN number (optional, string, pattern: "^[0-9-]{10,17}$")
- status: Reading status (optional, select, options: ["to-read", "reading", "completed"])
- tags: Topic tags (optional, array)
- finished_date: Date completed (optional, date)
```

### Validation and Error Handling

- **Required Field Validation**: Ensures all required fields are present
- **Type Validation**: Verifies field values match expected types
- **Constraint Validation**: Enforces min/max, patterns, and selection options
- **Unknown Field Warnings**: Warns about fields not defined in schema
- **Helpful Error Messages**: Clear feedback when validation fails

2. **Generate default config**: Create `config.yml` with optimal defaults
3. **Create note type directories**: Set up folders for all default note types
4. **Generate description files**: Create `_description.md` for each note type with instructions and schemas
5. **Create welcome note**: Generate an introductory note explaining the vault structure and how to get started

## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies
- **Runtime**: Node.js 18+
- **MCP SDK**: @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
- **File Operations**: Node.js fs/promises
- **Search**: Simple text search with regex support, with plans for vector search
- **Configuration**: YAML parsing (js-yaml)

### Configuration Schema

#### Global Configuration (~/.flint-note/config.yml)
```yaml
# Global vault registry
vaults:
  work:
    name: "Work Notes"
    path: "~/work-notes"
    description: "Professional projects and meeting notes"
    last_used: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  personal:
    name: "Personal Journal"
    path: "~/personal-notes"
    description: "Personal thoughts, goals, and interests"
    last_used: "2024-01-14T20:15:00Z"

current_vault: "work"  # Currently active vault

mcp_server:
  port: 3000
  log_level: "info"
  auto_switch_vault: true  # Switch vault context based on MCP client requests
```

#### Per-Vault Configuration (.flint-note/config.yml in each vault)
```yaml
# Individual vault configuration
vault_id: "work"
workspace_root: "."
default_note_type: "general"
search:
  index_enabled: true
  index_path: ".jade-note/search-index.json"
note_types:
  auto_create_directories: true
  require_descriptions: true
metadata:
  validate_on_create: true
  validate_on_update: true
  strict_validation: false  # If true, unknown fields cause errors instead of warnings
```

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of missing directories
- Validation of note type names (filesystem-safe)
- Concurrent file access protection
- MCP protocol error responses
- Regex validation and error handling for malformed patterns
- Metadata schema validation with detailed error messages
- Type coercion and constraint validation
- Unknown field warnings vs. errors based on configuration

### Security Considerations
- Restrict file operations to workspace directory
- Validate all file paths to prevent directory traversal
- No execution of user-provided code
- Read-only access to system files
- Sanitize metadata field names and values
- Validate regex patterns in metadata constraints
- Prevent schema injection attacks through field definitions
