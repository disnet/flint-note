Flint note is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides an agent-first note-taking system designed from the ground up for AI collaboration. Instead of adding AI features to traditional notes, Flint treats AI agents as your primary interface for creating, organizing, and connecting your knowledge.

## Key features

- **Agent-first design** - AI agents understand your note types and guide you through creating structured content
- **Local markdown storage** - Your notes are plain markdown files you own and control forever
- **MCP server architecture** - Connects to any AI client that supports the Model Context Protocol
- **Intelligent note types** - Each note type has its own agent instructions and metadata schema
- **Customizable AI behavior** - Tell agents how to behave for each note type using natural language

## Pre-requisites

- Node.js 18+
- Any [MCP capable client](https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-clients) (e.g., Claude Desktop, Cursor, Raycast, etc.)

### How It Works

1. **flint-note server** runs locally on your machine, managing your markdown files
2. **AI clients** (like Claude Desktop) connect to the server via MCP
3. **AI agents** can read your note types, understand their schemas, and help create content

### Getting Started

Add flint-note to your client's MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "flint-note": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@flint-note/server@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Adding Custom Prompts for Better AI Behavior

For the best experience, add a custom prompt that makes your AI assistant understand flint-note's agent-first design. The [prompts/](./prompts) directory contains optimized prompts for different AI models and platforms. If you want to get started quickly, just start your conversation by pasting in the following prompt:

```
You have access to flint-note, an intelligent note-taking system with multi-vault support designed for natural conversation-based knowledge management.

CORE BEHAVIORS:
- Be conversational: "I've added that to your work vault meeting notes" vs "Note created successfully"
- Be proactive: extract action items, suggest connections, improve organization
- Be vault-aware: understand current vault context and adapt behavior accordingly
- Follow agent instructions: adapt behavior based on note type-specific agent instructions
- Use metadata intelligently: validate and populate metadata schemas automatically
- Use content hashes safely: always include content_hash when updating notes to prevent conflicts
- Evolve continuously: suggest agent instruction improvements based on usage patterns

ESSENTIAL WORKFLOW:
1. Check current vault context using get_current_vault when needed
2. Determine appropriate note type based on content and vault context
3. **ALWAYS use get_note_type_info to check agent instructions BEFORE creating notes**
4. Structure information meaningfully using note type guidelines and agent instructions
5. Extract actionable items: `- [ ] Task (Owner: Name, Due: Date)`
6. Follow agent_instructions returned from create_note for contextual follow-up
7. Use batch operations efficiently for creating or updating multiple related notes
8. **ALWAYS include content_hash when updating notes** - get current version first with get_note
9. Use search tools effectively for discovery and connections
10. Use update_note_type to refine agent instructions based on user feedback
11. Populate metadata schemas automatically when possible

**CRITICAL**: NEVER create notes without first checking agent instructions with get_note_type_info

VAULT MANAGEMENT:
- Always understand which vault is currently active
- Help users create and switch between vaults for different contexts (work, personal, research)
- Provide vault-aware suggestions and organization
- Use list_vaults, create_vault, switch_vault, get_current_vault as needed
- Adapt behavior based on vault purpose and context

AGENT INSTRUCTIONS SYSTEM:
- **MANDATORY**: Check agent instructions with get_note_type_info before creating ANY note
- Agent instructions define note type-specific behaviors
- Follow them religiously for contextual assistance
- Suggest improvements when you notice gaps or patterns
- Use them to provide increasingly personalized experiences
- Never create notes without understanding their behavioral requirements

CONTENT HASH SAFETY:
- **ALWAYS include content_hash when updating notes** - prevents conflicts and data loss
- Get current note version with get_note before making updates
- Handle CONTENT_HASH_MISMATCH errors by explaining conflicts and offering resolution
- Include content_hash for each update in batch operations
- Explain to users when conflicts occur: "The note was modified by another process"

BATCH OPERATIONS:
- Use batch create_note for 3+ related notes (project planning, imports, etc.)
- Use batch update_note for bulk status changes or metadata updates
- **Include content_hash for each update in batch operations** for safety
- Handle partial failures gracefully - report success/failure counts with specific errors
- Group related operations for efficiency
- Provide clear feedback on batch results to users

SEARCH SYSTEM:
- **search_notes**: Fast full-text search with content ranking and type filtering
- **search_notes_advanced**: Structured search with metadata filters, date ranges, and sorting
- **search_notes_sql**: Direct SQL queries for complex analytical searches
- Always use search to find related notes and suggest connections
- Leverage metadata filters for precise discovery
- Use FTS ranking to surface most relevant content

Focus on making note-taking effortless while building a valuable, adaptive knowledge base across multiple organized vaults.

## Example Agent Conversations

### Agent-Guided Note Creation


> You: I just finished reading "The Psychology of Money"
>
> Agent: I'll create a reading note for you. Based on your reading note schema, I need:
> - Your rating (1-5 stars)
> - Key insights that stuck with you
> - The author's name
>
> What would you rate this book?
>
> You: I'd give it a 4/5. Main insight was how behavior matters more than knowledge in investing.
>
> Agent: Perfect! I'm creating your reading note with Morgan Housel as author, 4/5 rating, and that key insight. The note will be saved as reading/psychology-of-money.md


### Intelligent Note Suggestions

> You: Create a project note for our website redesign
>
> Agent: I'll set up a project note. Based on your project schema, I should include:
> - Project goals and success criteria
> - Key milestones and deadlines
> - Team members and stakeholders
> - Risk assessment
>
> What's the main goal for this redesign?
>
> You: Improve user engagement and reduce support tickets by 30%
>
> Agent: Excellent! I'll create projects/website-redesign.md with that goal and template sections for milestones, team, and risks. Should I link this to any existing notes?

### Smart Metadata and Organization

> You: Add a meeting note for today's standup
>
> Agent: Creating your meeting note. I see you have a standup template that includes:
> - Attendees
> - What did we accomplish yesterday?
> - What are we working on today?
> - Any blockers?
>
> Who attended today's standup?
>
> You: The whole team - Sarah, Mike, Alex, and me
>
> Agent: Got it! I'll create meetings/standup-2024-01-15.md with those attendees and the standup template. The metadata will automatically tag this as a "standup" meeting for easy filtering later. The note includes a content hash for safe future updates.


### Safe Concurrent Updates

> You: Update my project status to completed
>
> Agent: I'll update your project note safely. Let me get the current version with its content hash first... Now updating with hash verification to prevent conflicts. ✅ Project status updated to completed with content hash protection.
>
> You: What if someone else was editing it?
>
> Agent: The content hash system would detect that conflict and alert me to get the latest version first. This prevents accidentally overwriting changes made by other agents or processes.

## How Note Types Work

flint-note organizes your knowledge using **note types** - each with its own purpose, agent instructions, and metadata schema. Your workspace looks like this:

```
my-notes/
├── .flint-note/
│   └── config.yml
├── reading/
│   ├── _description.md          # Defines how agents help with reading notes
│   ├── the-unaccountability-machine.md
├── projects/
│   ├── _description.md          # Defines how agents help with projects
│   ├── website-redesign.md
│   └── mobile-app.md
├── meetings/
│   ├── _description.md          # Defines how agents handle meeting notes
│   └── team-standup-2024-01-15.md
└── daily/
    ├── _description.md          # Defines daily note format and prompts
    └── 2024-01-15.md
```

Each `_description.md` file tells agents how to behave for that note type:

```markdown
# Reading Notes

## Purpose
Track books, articles, and papers with structured insights and ratings.

## Agent Instructions
- Always ask for the author's background and credentials
- Extract key insights and actionable takeaways
- Request a personal rating (1-5 stars) and what made it memorable
- Suggest connections to other readings in the vault
- Encourage specific quotes with page references

## Metadata Schema
- title: Book/article title (required, string)
- author: Author name (required, string)
- rating: Personal rating (required, number, min: 1, max: 5)
- status: Reading progress (required, select: to_read|reading|completed)
- tags: Topic categories (optional, array)
- isbn: ISBN for books (optional, string)
```

### Customizing Agent Behavior

You can modify how agents work with any note type just by talking to them:


> You: Update my reading notes so agents always ask about the book's publication year
>
> Agent: I'll update your reading note instructions to include asking about publication year.
>
> [Updates reading/_description.md with the new instruction]
>
> You: Make project notes more focused on deadlines and blockers
>
> Agent: I'll modify your project note instructions to emphasize deadline tracking and proactive blocker identification.
>
> [Updates projects/_description.md accordingly]

## Configuration

Flint Note automatically manages its configuration and will upgrade older vaults seamlessly. The configuration is stored in `.flint-note/config.yml` in each vault.


### Configuration Settings

Key configuration sections include:

- **deletion**: Controls note and note type deletion behavior
  - `require_confirmation`: Requires explicit confirmation for deletions (default: true)
  - `create_backups`: Creates backups before deletion (default: true)
  - `backup_path`: Where to store backups (default: `.flint-note/backups`)
  - `allow_note_type_deletion`: Allows deletion of entire note types (default: true)
  - `max_bulk_delete`: Maximum notes that can be deleted in one operation (default: 10)
