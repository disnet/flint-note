          <h2>You capture and link. Then what?</h2>
          <p class="problem-intro">
            Most apps optimize for getting thoughts out of your head. That's the easy
            part.
          </p>

          <div class="problem-list">
            <p>Your notes pile up</p>
            <p>You never look at them again</p>
            <p>They don't change how you think</p>
          </div>

          <p class="problem-hard">
            Some tools add linking—but connection-making alone isn't learning. You can
            have a beautiful knowledge graph and still never <em>know</em> anything.
          </p>

          <p class="problem-hard">
            The hard part is making ideas actually <em>yours</em>—integrating them into
            your mental models, retrieving them at the right moment, applying them without
            thinking.
          </p>

          <div class="problem-failures">
            <p>Reading something doesn't mean understanding it</p>
            <p>Writing something down doesn't mean remembering it</p>
            <p>Having it doesn't mean using it</p>
          </div>

          <p class="problem-conclusion">
            Real learning requires reflection, connection-making, spaced repetition,
            active recall—the hard, unglamorous work that turns information into
            internalized knowledge. If you're going to take notes at all, they should make
            you smarter over time. Flint is designed so they do.
