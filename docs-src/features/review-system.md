# Review System

Flint includes a spaced repetition review system to help you remember and retain important information from your notes.

## Overview

The review system uses spaced repetition algorithms to:

- Schedule reviews at optimal intervals
- Help you commit information to long-term memory
- Track your learning progress over time

## How It Works

### Spaced Repetition

Spaced repetition is a learning technique that:

- Shows you information at increasing intervals
- Adapts to your performance (correct vs. incorrect recalls)
- Maximizes retention while minimizing review time

### Review Scheduling

Reviews are automatically scheduled based on:

- Your performance on previous reviews
- The difficulty of the material
- Time since last review

## Using the Review System

### Marking Content for Review

You can mark content for review in several ways:

- Mark entire notes for review
- Create review blocks within notes
- Use the review button in the note toolbar

### Daily Reviews

Access your daily reviews from:

- The review button in the sidebar
- The daily review notification
- Keyboard shortcut (configurable)

### Review Interface

During a review session:

1. The content is presented
2. Try to recall the information
3. Rate your recall (Again, Hard, Good, Easy)
4. Next review is automatically scheduled
