# Daily Notes

Daily notes provide a frictionless way to externalize your thoughts. Each day gets its own note where you can capture ideas, reflections, and observations as they happen—without worrying about where they belong or how to organize them.

## What are Daily Notes?

**Daily notes are your default space for thinking out loud.** They anchor your thoughts to time, creating a chronological record that makes it easy to:

- Capture fleeting ideas before they're lost
- Track what you're working on and learning
- Connect daily observations to larger projects through wikilinks
- Review patterns in your thinking over time

The week-based view shows seven days at once, making it natural to see context and rhythm in your work.
