# Core Concepts

How Flint's features work together to help you write, connect, and remember.

## The Core Idea

Most note-taking apps focus on one thing:

- **Capture tools** help you write but don't help you find things later
- **Study tools** help with memorization but make note-taking tedious
- **Writing tools** focus on output but don't help you build on past work

**Flint brings these together.** Write freely, link ideas, and come back to notes at the right time.

## How It Works

### Write: Capture Ideas Without Friction

**The problem:** Worrying about "where does this go?" slows you down.

**Flint's solution:** Write freely. The system handles organization through [note types](/features/notes#note-types) and relationships.

**Example:** Create a meeting note without deciding its folder, tags, or final structure. Mark it processed later when you've extracted action items and linked related concepts.

### Connect: Link Ideas Together

**The problem:** Notes pile up and you can't find connections between them.

**Flint's solution:**

- Wikilinks let you create connections as you write
- [Note types](/features/notes#note-types) organize different kinds of content
- The [AI agent](/features/agent) helps find related notes
- Backlinks show you where ideas connect

**Example:** While writing about a project decision, linking to `[[past-failures]]` and `[[design-principles]]` helps you see patterns. You can click through to review related thinking.

### Remember: Come Back to Notes at the Right Time

**The problem:** Most notes are written once and never seen again.

**Flint's solution:**

- [Spaced repetition](/features/review-system) brings notes back on a schedule
- AI generates prompts to help you engage with old notes
- Backlinks surface where ideas appear across your notes

**Example:** The [review system](/features/review-system) brings back notes you want to remember, with AI-generated prompts that help you think about them in new ways.

## Features Overview

### Notes

You think in ideas, not files. The system handles file naming, folder structure, and organization.

- **Type-driven** - Organization emerges from content and relationships
- **Frictionless** - No decisions about "where does this go?"

See [Notes](/features/notes) for details.

### Note Types

Different notes serve different purposes. Types help you organize and the AI understands what kind of note you're working with.

- **Evergreen notes** → long-lasting ideas and concepts
- **Predictions** → claims you can check later
- **Daily notes** → journal entries and quick capture
- **Meeting notes** → action items and context

See [Note Types](/features/notes#note-types) and [Daily Notes](/features/daily-notes).

### Wikilinks & Backlinks

Create connections as you write.

- Type `[[Link]]` to connect notes
- Backlinks panel shows where notes are referenced
- Build a personal knowledge graph over time

### AI Agent

An assistant that knows your notes and helps you work with them.

- Create and edit notes through conversation
- Find related notes and suggest connections
- Generate review prompts
- Process your inbox

See [AI Agent](/features/agent).

### Review System

Spaced repetition without the flashcard overhead.

1. Mark a note "for review"
2. AI generates a prompt
3. Answer and rate how well you remembered
4. System reschedules based on performance

See [Review System](/features/review-system).

### Reference Shelf

Keep multiple notes visible while editing. Works like physical reference materials on a desk.

### Pinned Notes & Workspaces

Pin notes for quick access. Drag to reorder. [Workspaces](/guides/interface#workspaces-bar) group pinned notes for different projects.

See [Workspaces](/guides/interface#workspaces-bar).

### Inbox

All recent notes in one place. Mark as processed when reviewed.

## Best Practices

**Let structure emerge.** Don't over-plan. Start with general notes, notice patterns, create types as needs become clear.

**Write → Connect → Remember.** Capture ideas, link them together, review what matters.
