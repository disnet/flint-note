# Core Concepts

This guide explains Flint's fundamental philosophy and how its features work together to support deep knowledge building.

## The Core Philosophy

**Flint builds deep knowledge by supporting the complete cycle of externalizing (getting ideas out), internalizing (making them yours), and resurfacing (bringing them back repeatedly over time to ground memory).**

Most tools optimize for one part of this cycle:

- **Capture tools** (quick notes, voice memos) focus on externalizing but offer little support for processing or retention
- **Study tools** (flashcards, spaced repetition) focus on resurfacing but make initial capture painful
- **Writing tools** (Notion, Google Docs) focus on structured output but don't help with learning or recall

**Flint optimizes for the entire process.** Reducing friction in all three areas is critical—but the philosophy is fundamentally about building deep knowledge itself.

## The Three Phases of Deep Knowledge

### Externalizing: Getting Ideas Out

**The problem:** Most note systems create friction at the moment of capture because you worry about organization—"Where does this go? What should I name it? How do I tag it?"

**Flint's approach:**

- **Frictionless capture** - The system handles organization through note types and relationships
- **No premature structure** - You don't need to decide on folder hierarchies before thinking through material
- **Trust the process** - Quick capture now, organize later with confidence

**How it works:**

- Notes as first-class abstractions—you think in terms of ideas, not files or folders
- Note types guide what and how you capture without imposing rigid structure
- Inbox provides a safety net so nothing gets lost

### Internalizing: Making Knowledge Yours

**The problem:** Highlighting, re-reading, and passive review don't build deep understanding. Real learning requires active engagement, connection-making, and synthesis.

**Flint's approach:**

- **Connection as learning** - Wikilinks and backlinks force you to see relationships between ideas
- **Type-guided thinking** - Different note types encode different thinking patterns (synthesis, prediction, reflection)
- **AI as thought partner** - The agent helps you process, connect, and refine without replacing your thinking
- **Active recall** - Review system tests understanding, not just recognition

**How it works:**

- Backlinks show where ideas have been applied across time
- Note types shape how you think about material (evergreen → synthesis, prediction → calibration)
- Agent suggestions provide real-time feedback during writing
- Review system with AI-generated prompts for active recall practice

### Resurfacing: Building Long-Term Memory

**The problem:** Most notes get written once and never seen again. Without systematic resurfacing, knowledge fades.

**Flint's approach:**

- **Spaced repetition built in** - Review system reschedules notes based on performance
- **Routines for synthesis** - Regular practices (weekly reviews, reading processing) become habitual
- **Semantic discovery** - Search and backlinks make past thinking discoverable
- **Connection-based recall** - Related notes surface automatically through the link structure

**How it works:**

- Mark notes for review; AI generates test prompts on schedule
- Routines automate recurring workflows (weekly synthesis, prediction calibration)
- Search works on ideas and connections, not just keywords
- Backlinks and suggestions resurface related concepts as you work

## How Features Support the Cycle

### Notes as First-Class Abstractions

**Philosophy:** Notes are the unit of thinking, not files or implementation details.

**What this means:**

- You never think about where files live, how to name them, or folder structures
- Notes have stable IDs independent of titles—rename freely without breaking connections
- The system handles storage; you focus on ideas

**Supports:**

- **Externalizing** - Capture friction eliminated; the system handles organization
- **Internalizing** - Wikilinks and backlinks surface relationships
- **Resurfacing** - Semantic abstraction makes thinking discoverable

### Note Types System

**Philosophy:** Different types of knowledge need different thinking patterns.

**What this means:**

- Note types are organizational primitives AND cognitive guides
- Evergreen notes guide synthesis and universalization
- Predictions force falsifiable claims with calibration
- Daily notes structure reflection and progress tracking
- Meeting notes capture action items and context

**Supports:**

- **Externalizing** - Types guide what and how you capture
- **Internalizing** - Agent instructions per type help consistent processing
- **Resurfacing** - Type structure enables pattern discovery

### Wikilinks & Backlinks

**Philosophy:** Making connections explicit is how learning deepens.

**What this means:**

- [[Links]] force you to externalize relationships as you write
- Backlinks show where ideas have been applied, revealing patterns
- Build a knowledge graph that mirrors how you actually think

**Supports:**

- **Externalizing** - Forces relationship thinking during writing
- **Internalizing** - Backlinks surface connections across time
- **Resurfacing** - Navigate by association; discover unexpected links

### The AI Agent System

**Philosophy:** Not generating thoughts, but intelligently supporting all three learning phases.

**What this means:**

- Conversational partner with semantic access to your full note system
- Understands note types, relationships, content, and learning patterns
- Helps you capture better, connect deeper, resurface at right moments
- Type-aware assistance—creates evergreen notes differently than predictions

**Supports all three phases:**

- **Externalizing** - Helps structure and capture ideas conversationally
- **Internalizing** - Suggests connections, provides feedback, helps synthesize
- **Resurfacing** - Executes routines, generates review prompts, surfaces related notes

### Review System (Spaced Repetition)

**Philosophy:** Active recall is the most effective learning mechanism, but writing test prompts creates friction.

**What this means:**

- Mark notes "for review" with one button click
- Agent generates contextual test prompts from note content
- Answer, get feedback, rate performance
- System reschedules based on how well you recalled

**Supports:**

- **Internalizing** - Active recall builds deep understanding
- **Resurfacing** - Spaced repetition brings notes back on optimal schedule

### Routines

**Philosophy:** Systematizing recurring workflows creates regular practices for learning.

**What this means:**

- Scheduled skills for the agent (weekly reviews, reading processing, prediction calibration)
- Reduces friction by automating scheduling and execution
- Build sustainable learning habits without discipline burden

**Supports:**

- **Externalizing** - Structured review prompts during routine execution
- **Internalizing** - Regular synthesis sessions
- **Resurfacing** - Recurring reflection makes it habitual

### Reference Shelf

**Philosophy:** Keep context available without losing focus.

**What this means:**

- Add multiple notes to sidebar while editing main note
- Live editors on each reference note
- Mirrors how writers use physical reference materials on a desk

**Supports:**

- **Externalizing** - Maintain context while developing ideas
- **Internalizing** - Draw connections without switching contexts

### Pinned Notes & Spatial Memory

**Philosophy:** Messiness during exploration is okay; the system makes cleanup easy.

**What this means:**

- Pinned notes provide stable anchor for active work
- Recent notes track exploration without losing thread
- Drag-and-drop manual positioning (not auto-sorted)
- Trust that you can make a mess and restore order

**Supports:**

- **Externalizing** - Fluid exploration without organization anxiety
- **Internalizing** - Spatial memory works like a messy desk—you know where things are
- **Resurfacing** - Easy return to context after exploring

### Inbox

**Philosophy:** Removes "will I find this later?" anxiety during capture.

**What this means:**

- All recent notes listed in one place
- Mark as processed when reviewed
- Lightweight routine for confirming you're happy with captures

**Supports:**

- **Externalizing** - Capture fluidly without worry
- **Internalizing** - Processing inbox becomes entry point for reflection

## Key Design Principles

### Notes, Not Files

You work with notes and their connections. The system handles:

- File naming and storage
- Folder organization
- Metadata structure
- Link management

You see ideas; the system handles implementation.

### Type-Guided Thinking

Note types aren't just organizational—they shape how you think:

- Creating an evergreen note prompts synthesis
- Creating a prediction forces falsifiable framing
- Creating a daily note structures reflection

The type itself is a cognitive tool.

### Immutable Identity

Notes have stable IDs independent of titles:

- Rename freely without breaking links
- Reorganize without fear
- Refactor structure as understanding evolves

### Content-Centric Organization

How notes are organized emerges from content and relationships:

- Not predetermined folder hierarchies
- Connections reflect actual thinking patterns
- Structure becomes clear through use

**Flint is the only tool designed around the complete externalize → internalize → resurface cycle.**

## Mental Model

Think of Flint as:

- **A thinking system** that grows with you
- **A learning partner** that handles mechanical tasks
- **A knowledge graph** that reflects how your mind actually works
- **A practice system** that builds sustainable learning habits

It's NOT:

- A filing cabinet (organization emerges, not imposed)
- A chatbot (AI assists thinking, doesn't replace it)
- A writing tool (focus is learning, not output)
- A database (structure follows content, not schema)

## Best Practices

### Start Simple

Don't try to use every feature immediately:

1. **Week 1**: Create notes, add wikilinks
2. **Week 2**: Try note types, use the inbox
3. **Week 3**: Use AI agent for organization
4. **Week 4**: Add routines and review practice

### Let Structure Emerge

Don't over-plan your system:

- Start with general notes
- Notice patterns in your thinking
- Create note types as needs become clear
- Use the agent to help identify structure

### Trust the Process

The complete cycle builds knowledge:

1. **Capture** fluidly without friction (externalize)
2. **Connect** related ideas with links (internalize)
3. **Process** periodically with routines (internalize)
4. **Review** on schedule (resurface)
5. **Synthesize** insights through agent assistance (internalize)

### Use the Agent as Partner

The AI is most powerful when you:

- Ask it to find connections between notes
- Use it to process your inbox
- Let it generate review prompts
- Have it execute your routines
- Request synthesis of themes across notes

But remember: the insights come from **you**.
