## Strategic Foundation

The landing page must communicate that **Flint supports the complete deep thinking cycle** (externalizing → internalizing → resurfacing through spaced repetition), not just note storage.

**Core positioning**: "Spark deep understanding—a note-taking app that transforms captured thoughts into internalized knowledge."

Capture is easy. Learning is hard. Most apps stop at capture. Flint keeps going.

**Simplified positioning for general audiences**: "Flint helps you learn better by making it easy to capture your thoughts, connect them over time, and bring them back when you need them."

**Target audience**:

- **Primary**: People who care about _how_ they think and learn deeply—researchers, writers, product builders, builders of systems who want to internalize ideas so they become part of their mental models.
- **Secondary**: Anyone interested in note-taking apps who wants their notes to actually stick and influence how they think, not just pile up in storage

## Landing Page Structure

### Section 1: Hero

**Goal**: Hook immediately, establish the unique value prop, create cognitive resonance

**Layout**: Hero with headline, subheadline, visual, and CTA

**Headline**: "Spark deep understanding"

**Subheadline (for technical audience)**: "A note-taking app designed to spark deep understanding, not just capture."

**Subheadline (for general audience)**: "Capture your thoughts, connect them together, and bring them back when you need them—so ideas actually stick."

**Visual**: Information flowing through the system, being transformed from raw input to internalized knowledge that shapes how you think

**CTA Primary**: "Try Flint" or "Experience the Learning Cycle" (not "Sign up")

**CTA Secondary**: "See how it works" (demo/walkthrough link)

**Tone**: Confident, specific (avoid generic), philosophically grounded

---

### Section 2: The Problem (Why This Matters)

**Goal**: Resonate with the target audience's pain point—they capture obsessively but rarely internalize

**Structure**:

- **Hook**: "You capture. Then what?"
- **The Gap**: Most apps optimize for _getting thoughts out of your head_. That's the easy part.
  - Your notes pile up
  - You never look at them again
  - They don't change how you think
- **The Hard Part**: Making captured ideas actually _yours_—integrating them into your mental models, retrieving them at the right moment, applying them without thinking
- **Why Capture Alone Fails**:
  - Reading something doesn't mean understanding it
  - Writing something down doesn't mean remembering it
  - Having it doesn't mean using it
- **What Learning Actually Requires**: Reflection, connection-making, spaced repetition, active recall—the hard, unglamorous work that turns information into internalized knowledge
- **Why This Matters**: If you're going to take notes at all, they should make you smarter over time. Flint is designed so they do

**Visual**: Visual showing the gap: easy capture vs. hard internalization. Show that most tools optimize the left side, Flint optimizes the right

**Tone**: Empathetic to frustration, grounded in learning science

### Section 3: Three Core Pillars (How Flint Works)

**Goal**: Make the complete learning cycle concrete through three interconnected features

**Structure**: Three visual cards or sections (could be interactive/expandable)

#### Pillar 1: Externalize Intelligently

- **Concept**: Structured capture through note types and agent guidance
- **Why It Matters**: How you capture shapes what and how you think
- **Features**:
  - Note types encode different thinking patterns (daily, evergreen, predictions, etc.)
  - Agent suggests inline as you write, deepening thinking through semantic understanding
  - Metadata schemas per type guide what questions you ask as you capture
- **Outcome**: You externalize not just _what_ you're thinking, but you're thinking _deeper_ in the moment of capture

#### Pillar 2: Internalize Continuously

- **Concept**: Routines, agent partnership, connections made visible
- **Why It Matters**: Deep learning happens through reflection and connection-making, not passive storage
- **Features**:
  - Routines systematize recurring reflection (daily reviews, weekly syntheses, calibration)
  - Agent with semantic API understands note types and relationships, providing type-aware assistance
  - Wikilinks and backlinks make connections explicit and discoverable
  - Reference Shelf keeps related notes visible while you work, creating passive association
- **Outcome**: You're not just storing knowledge—you're continuously synthesizing and connecting it

#### Pillar 3: Resurface Systematically

- **Concept**: Spaced repetition scheduling, forced recall, agent-generated prompts
- **Why It Matters**: Repeated encounters at optimal intervals cement ideas into how you think
- **Features**:
  - Review System brings notes back at calculated intervals based on performance
  - Backlinks surface where ideas recur, forcing pattern recognition
  - Agent generates contextual prompts to test active recall (not passive rereading)
  - Routines surface your best ideas at intervals optimized for long-term retention
- **Outcome**: Ideas become part of how you think, not just what you know

**Design Approach**: Each pillar gets a concise explanation + 2-3 concrete features + outcome statement

---

### Section 4: The Complete Cycle in Action

**Goal**: Show the end-to-end learning journey with a concrete example

**Structure**: Animated or step-by-step walkthrough

**Example Journey**:

1. **Capture**: You read an article on a topic. You highlight a key passage in your Reading note, capture it with context.
2. **Connect**: Agent analyzes the note, suggests three related concepts from your existing evergreen notes.
3. **Reflect**: You create wikilinks to those concepts. A connection emerges you hadn't seen before—you capture a new insight.
4. **Routine**: Your weekly synthesis routine runs. It surfaces this reading and the connections you made, prompts you to synthesize into a bigger principle.
5. **Resurface**: Two weeks later, a spaced repetition routine brings back that synthesized principle. Your brain must retrieve it from memory first. You encounter it again, reinforcing the learning.
6. **Realize**: Days or weeks later, in conversation or on a new project, you realize you're applying this principle instinctively. It's become part of how you think.

**Narrative**: "Here's what deep learning looks like in Flint..."

**Visual**: Flow diagram or short video showing each step

---

### Section 5: The Agent System (Not Just Another AI)

**Goal**: Clarify that this isn't ChatGPT + notes, but a differentiated product

**Structure**: Dedicated section or callout within Pillar 2

**Key Messages**:

- Your agent is integrated with your learning system through a semantic API
- It understands note types, relationships, and your thinking patterns
- It provides type-aware assistance (different guidance for evergreen vs predictions vs daily notes)
- The agent is not generating new thoughts—it's making sure your best thinking resurfaces at optimal intervals
- This is fundamentally different from a general-purpose chatbot plugin

**Visual**: Show agent understanding note types and suggesting connections, executing routines with context, generating spaced review prompts

**Tone**: Technical but accessible—empower the philosophy-curious with concrete understanding

---

### Section 6: Positioning Against Link-Focused Tools

**Goal**: Address the question: "How is this different from Obsidian/Roam Research?"

**The Core Differentiation**: Connection-making alone isn't learning.

**Key Messages**:

- **Link-focused tools optimize for discovery** (finding connections), not retention (making sure those connections stick in your brain)
- You can have a beautiful knowledge graph and still never actually internalize anything
- **Flint optimizes for the complete cycle**: Capture → Connect → Systematically Resurface
- Linking is a _feature_ in Flint, not the product. The product is learning.
- The unglamorous work—spaced repetition, forced recall, routine reflection—is where real learning happens. Most tools stop before this.

**What They'd Encounter**: "Doesn't Flint have linking?"

**Answer**: "Yes. But linking is just one component of a complete learning system. The real differentiator is what happens _after_ you make connections—how do we ensure those connections become part of how you think?"

**Honest Positioning**: "If all you're doing is making connections, you're not actually learning—you're just visualizing confusion."

**In Copy**:

- Avoid: "Better than other graph-based tools"
- Instead: "Most note apps stop at capture. Some add connections. Flint keeps going—we systematically resurface ideas so they become part of how you think."

**Visual Strategy**: In the "Complete Cycle" section (Section 4), make clear that other tools handle steps 1-3 (capture, connect, reflect), but skip the critical steps 4-6 (resurface, review, internalize). Emphasize that Flint is purpose-built for the complete journey.

---

### Section 7: Trust & Autonomy

**Goal**: Address the target audience's concern about data lock-in and platform dependence

**Structure**: Visual callout or trust section

**Messages**:

- Your vault is files on your computer—markdown, portable, yours forever
- ID-based wikilinks never break when you rename notes
- You're not trapped in a cloud service or dependent on Flint's future
- Open format means you can switch AI providers or run inference locally as models improve
- This is epistemological autonomy—your thinking is not hostage to enshittification or vendor lock-in

**Visual**: Open file structure, open formats, arrows showing data portability

**Tone**: Reassuring, grounded in respect for user agency

---

### Section 8: Who This Is For

**Goal**: Reinforce target audience and use cases

**Structure**: 3-4 concrete personas or use cases

**Examples**:

- **Researchers**: Track papers, extract highlights, surface connections between research threads, resurface at optimal intervals to synthesize novel insights
- **Product Builders**: Capture strategy and design thinking, track competitors and patterns, resurface assumptions for calibration and adjustment
- **Writers**: Develop ideas over time, surface relevant thinking during drafting, resurface past writing to avoid repetition and build on prior thinking
- **Lifelong Learners**: Build deep understanding through spaced repetition, connect ideas across disciplines, watch thinking evolve over months and years

**Why Flint**: Each persona benefits from the complete learning cycle, not just capture

---

### Section 9: CTA Section (Below the Fold)

**Goal**: Convert interest to action

**Structure**: Primary + secondary CTAs with value prop reinforcement

**Primary CTA**: "Start Free" or "Try Flint" (no credit card required)

**Secondary CTAs**:

- "See a demo" (video or interactive walkthrough)
- "Read the philosophy" (blog post or docs link)
- "Join the community" (Discord/community link)

**Messaging**: Reinforce that you're starting with full access, no paywall or artificial restrictions at the start

## Feature Demonstration with Screenshots

Show off core capabilities through real examples:

1. **Agent in Action** - Screenshot of agent suggesting connections, asking clarifying questions, or generating synthesis. Shows the "thinking partner" aspect.

2. **Note Linking & Graph** - Visual of how notes connect together, demonstrating how Flint builds a knowledge network rather than isolated documents.

3. **Review Mode** - Screenshot showing the spaced repetition review interface—clean, distraction-free, ready for practice. Emphasizes the "resurface" pillar.

4. **Daily Notes Entry** - Shows the low-friction quick capture interface. Demonstrates that input friction is minimized so you can focus on thinking, not formatting.

**Placement strategy**: Interleave these throughout the page after each pillar explanation, showing the feature that enables it.

## Key Design Principles

1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Don't explain everything at once. Hero communicates the outcome. Sections reveal how it works. Details are available for the curious
2. **Show, Don't Tell**: Use visuals, animated flows, concrete examples—not just feature lists
3. **Hierarchy**: Lead with the philosophy (what outcome you enable), then features (how you enable it), then specifics (when the prospect is already interested)
4. **Avoid Jargon**: "PKM," "semantic graph," "SRS" are confusing to outsiders. Translate to "deep learning," "connections," "spaced repetition"
5. **Agent as Enabler, Not Star**: The AI is critical but shouldn't be the headline. It's what makes the system work smoothly, not the novelty
6. **Trust Over Excitement**: Your target audience is skeptical of new tools. Ground every claim in philosophy, not hype

## Visual Style Notes

- The visual system should reflect the learning cycle: flow, connection, emergence
- Use consistent metaphors (cycle, network, layering/building) throughout
- Consider spatial/topological visuals (like Arc or Roam's graph view) to show connections
- Color could indicate note types (visual system already established in Flint UI)
- Motion/animation should enhance understanding, not distract

## Messaging Guardrails

### What NOT to Say

- "The best note app" (you're not—you're different)
- "AI writes for you" (misleading and against philosophy)
- "Stores everything" (not the differentiator)
- "Cross-platform sync" (table stakes, not differentiating)
- "Collaborative" (not the focus for this landing page)
- "PKM" or "knowledge graph" (jargon, turns off target audience)

### What TO Say

- **For general audiences**: "Learn better," "ideas that stick," "making connections," "bringing ideas back when you need them"
- **For technically literate audiences**: "Deep learning" and "spaced repetition" (your actual outcome)
- "Systematic thinking" (your philosophy)
- "Your thinking stays yours" (your trust prop)
- "Complete learning cycle" (your comprehensive approach)
- "Integrated AI agent" (technical accuracy)
