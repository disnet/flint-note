# FlintNote Server Modularization Plan

## Overview

The FlintNote MCP server (`src/server.ts`) has grown to over 3,000 lines and handles multiple responsibilities. This document outlines our modularization plan to break down the monolithic server into smaller, more focused modules for better maintainability and organization.

## Original Structure

The original `server.ts` file contained:
- **Size**: 3,254 lines
- **17 interfaces** defining request/response types
- **Large FlintNoteServer class** with 40+ methods handling:
  - Note operations (create, read, update, delete, rename, bulk operations)
  - Note type operations (create, update, delete, list, get info)
  - Search operations (basic, advanced, SQL search)
  - Vault operations (create, switch, remove, update, list)
  - Link operations (get links, backlinks, broken links, migrate)
  - Resource handlers (types, recent, stats)

## Modularization Plan

### âœ… **Step 1: Interface Extraction** (COMPLETED)
**Goal**: Move all interface definitions to a dedicated types file

**Implementation**:
- Created `src/server/types.ts` with all 17 interfaces
- Updated imports in `server.ts`
- Re-exported `ServerConfig` for external use

**Results**:
- Extracted 194 lines to dedicated types file
- Reduced main server file from 3,254 to 3,097 lines
- Better type organization and discoverability
- All tests passing âœ…

### âœ… **Step 2: Core Note Operations Extraction** (COMPLETED)
**Goal**: Extract core note-related handlers to a separate class

**Implementation**:

## Implementation Patterns

### Dependency Injection Pattern
```typescript
class NoteHandlers {
  constructor(
    private resolveVaultContext: (vaultId?: string) => Promise<VaultContext>,
    private generateNoteIdFromIdentifier: (identifier: string) => string,
    private requireWorkspace: () => void,
    private noteManager: any
  ) {}
}
```

### Error Handling Pattern
```typescript
// Success response
return {
  content: [{ type: 'text', text: JSON.stringify(result, null, 2) }]
};

// Error response
return {
  content: [{ 
    type: 'text', 
    text: JSON.stringify({ success: false, error: errorMessage }, null, 2) 
  }],
  isError: true
};
```

### Handler Integration Pattern
```typescript
// In main server setup
this.#noteHandlers = new NoteHandlers(
  this.#resolveVaultContext.bind(this),
  this.#generateNoteIdFromIdentifier.bind(this),
  this.#requireWorkspace.bind(this),
  this.#noteManager
);

// In request routing
case 'create_note':
  return await this.#noteHandlers.handleCreateNote(args);
```

## Current Status

- **Progress**: 8/8 steps completed (100%) ðŸŽ‰
- **Lines reduced**: 1,944+ lines moved to focused modules (3,254 â†’ 1,500)
- **Modules created**: 9 (`types.ts`: 194 lines, `note-handlers.ts`: 536 lines, `note-type-handlers.ts`: 496 lines, `vault-handlers.ts`: 349 lines, `search-handlers.ts`: 90 lines, `link-handlers.ts`: 366 lines, `resource-handlers.ts`: 61 lines, `server-utils.ts`: 80 lines, `tool-schemas.ts`: 977 lines)
- **Test coverage**: 100% maintained (1,024/1,024 tests passing)
- **Code quality**: All TypeScript and ESLint errors fixed
- **Breaking changes**: None - full backward compatibility preserved
